def next_permutation(perm):
    for i in range(len(perm) - 2, -1, -1):
        if perm[i] < perm[i + 1]:
            for j in range(len(perm) - 1, i, -1):
                if perm[j] > perm[i]:
                    next_perm = list(perm)
                    next_perm[i], next_perm[j] = next_perm[j], next_perm[i]
                    next_perm[i + 1:] = reversed(next_perm[i + 1:])

    return perm

The code was fixed by changing the condition from "perm[j] < perm[i]" to "perm[j] > perm[i]" in order to find the correct value to swap. Additionally, the variable "perm" was changed to "next_perm" in the line "next_perm[i], next_perm[j] = perm[j], perm[i]" to correctly assign the swapped values. Lastly, a return statement was added at the end of the function to return the original permutation if no next permutation is found.
