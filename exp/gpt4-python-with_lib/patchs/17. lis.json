Therefore I added `length + 1 in ends.keys()`.\n3) Update the `longest` variable inside the conditional block by taking the maximum between `longest` and `length + 1`, ensuring it always stores the length of the longest increasing subsequence found so far. \nNote that this function still assumes that the input list `arr` is non-empty. To handle an empty input list as well, you can add a condition at the start of the function to return 0 if `arr` is empty."
