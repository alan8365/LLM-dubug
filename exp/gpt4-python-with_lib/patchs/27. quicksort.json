If the input list is empty, the function instantly returns an empty list as there is nothing to sort. \n\nThe function works by selecting the first element of the array as a pivot, then dividing the rest of the array into two parts - one with elements less than the pivot and one with elements greater than the pivot. It then recursively sorts these two parts. Finally, it concatenates the sorted list of elements less than the pivot, the pivot itself, and the sorted list of elements greater than the pivot, and returns this concatenated list. \n\nThe quicksort algorithm is one of the most efficient sorting algorithms, with an average time complexity of O(n log n). This implementation uses list comprehensions, which is a pythonic way of creating new lists from existing lists, and makes the code concise and easy to read."
