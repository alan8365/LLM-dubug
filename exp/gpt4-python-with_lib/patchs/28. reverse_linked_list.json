Also, successor was used as an attribute and a method which is not a good practice. It was renamed to `get_successor` for getting the successor and `set_successor` for setting the successor. In the `reverse_linked_list` function, variables were renamed to more readable names and current_node was added for clarity."

Here is a simplified and corrected `Node` class:\n\n```python=\nclass Node:\n    def __init__(self, value=None, successor=None):\n        self.value = value\n        self.successor = successor\n```"

This caused the node to keep pointing to None and thus, the reverse linked list was not achieved. It is fixed in the updated code by adding the statement `prevnode = node` in the loop.\n\n```python=\nclass Node:\n    def __init__(self, value=None, successor=None, successors=[], predecessors=[], incoming_nodes=[], outgoing_nodes=[]):\n        self.value = value\n        self.successor = successor\n        self.successors = successors\n        self.predecessors = predecessors\n        self.incoming_nodes = incoming_nodes\n        self.outgoing_nodes = outgoing_nodes\n\n    def get_successor(self):\n        return self.successor\n\n    def get_successors(self):\n        return self.successors\n\n    def get_predecessors(self):\n        return self.predecessors\n```\n\nThe original class definition contained method names that were the same as property names. This caused potential confusion and errors. In the updated code, the `get_` prefix has been added to the method names to distinguish them from the properties."
