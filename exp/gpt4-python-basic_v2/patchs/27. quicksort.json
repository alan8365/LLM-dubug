To fix this, we should ensure that elements equal to the pivot are also correctly included in the result. Here\u2019s how you can do it:\n\n```python\ndef quicksort(arr):\n    if not arr:\n        return []\n\n    pivot = arr[0]\n    lesser = quicksort([x for x in arr[1:] if x < pivot])\n    equal = [x for x in arr if x == pivot]  # Include all instances of pivot.\n    greater = quicksort([x for x in arr[1:] if x > pivot])\n    return lesser + equal + greater\n```\n\nThis modified version of the `quicksort` function introduces a new list `equal` that collects all elements equal to the pivot, ensuring they are maintained in the final sorted array. This is a crucial step for maintaining the stability of the sort (where elements with equal keys retain their relative order) and ensuring correctness when there are duplicate elements in the input array."

Adding a new list `equal` that captures all elements equal to the `pivot`, including the pivot itself from all its occurrences in the list.\n2. The final return statement then concatenates `lesser`, `equal`, and `greater` lists to produce the sorted array.\n\nThis ensures that all elements equal to the pivot are grouped together and included in the final sorted list, thus maintaining stability and correctness of the quicksort algorithm in scenarios with repeated values.\n"
