Also, to ensure the code handles non-positive inputs correctly, we can add a simple check at the beginning to return appropriate values for negative `x` (since square root of a negative number is not defined in real numbers) or handle the case of `x = 0` directly.\n\nHere is the corrected code:\n\n```python\ndef sqrt(x, epsilon):\n    if x < 0:\n        return None  # or raise ValueError(\"Cannot compute square root of a negative number\")\n    elif x == 0:\n        return 0\n    approx = x / 2.0\n    while abs(approx**2 - x) > epsilon:\n        approx = 0.5 * (approx + x / approx)\n    return approx\n```\n\nIn this corrected code:\n- The function returns `None` for negative inputs unless you prefer to raise an exception. \n- If `x` is `0`, it immediately returns `0` since the square root of `0` is `0`.\n- The condition in the while loop has been fixed to `abs(approx**2 - x) > epsilon`.

Changed the `while` loop condition to `abs(approx * approx - x) > epsilon`. This ensures we are checking the closeness of the square of `approx` (`approx * approx`) to `x`, not `approx` to `x`.\n2. Added a check for negative inputs. Since the square root of a negative number isn't defined in the set of real numbers, the function now raises a `ValueError` if `x < 0`.\n3. Ensured `approx` is initialized as a float by writing `x / 2.0` to maintain float division in Python 2 (in Python 3, `x / 2` is sufficient for float division).\n\nThis version of the function is more robust and correctly implements the approximation for square roots using Newton's method."
