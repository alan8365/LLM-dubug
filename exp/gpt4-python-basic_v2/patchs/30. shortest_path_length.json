            "raw_code": "The provided code sample seems like an attempt to implement Dijkstra\u2019s algorithm using a heap (priority queue). There are several issues in the code:\n\n1. Incorrect use of the `get` function: This function currently returns `0` when the node is not found, which is not the expected behavior for this algorithm. It should probably return `None` or `inf`.\n2. In the loop updating distances, it incorrectly attempts to sum distances without checking if the node already exists in the heap.\n3.

            "raw_code": "The provided Python code contains several bugs and inefficiencies that need to be addressed to properly calculate the shortest path using a priority queue (heapq). Here's the corrected version of the code:\n\n1. Correct the `is` operator in the comparison `if node is goalnode:` to `if node == goalnode:`. Use `==` for value comparison.\n2. Fix logical issues in `insert_or_update` and `get` functions.\n3. Update logic to calculate new distance correctly in the loop.\n4. Ensure the heap property is maintained anytime the heap is modified.\n\nHere's the revised code:\n\n```python\nfrom heapq import heappush, heappop\n\ndef shortest_path_length(length_by_edge, startnode, goalnode):\n    unvisited_nodes = []\n    heappush(unvisited_nodes, (0, startnode))\n    visited_nodes = set()\n    distances = {startnode: 0}\n\n    while unvisited_nodes:\n        current_distance, current_node = heappop(unvisited_nodes)\n\n        if current_node == goalnode:\n            return current_distance\n\n        if current_node in visited_nodes:\n            continue\n\n        visited_nodes.add(current_node)\n\n        for nextnode in current_node.successors:\n            if nextnode in visited_nodes:\n                continue\n            \n            new_distance = current_distance + length_by_edge[(current_node, nextnode)]\n            \n            if nextnode not in distances or new_distance < distances[nextnode]:\n                distances[nextnode] = new_distance\n                heappush(unvisited_nodes, (new_distance, nextnode))\n\n    return float('inf')\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- The function uses a dictionary `distances` which holds the shortest known distances from the `startnode` to each node. This replaces the need for `get` and `insert_or_update` functions, simplifying the code.\n- The `heappush` method always adds the new distance-node pair directly to the heap. The check to avoid adding the same node with a longer distance is done by comparing `new_distance` with the existing value in the `distances` dictionary.\n- The loop continues until the `unvisited_nodes` heap is empty. If the current node is the goal node, the function immediately returns the current distance.\n- The use of the `==` operator correctly compares the nodes and ensures that the algorithm can work with any node data type where equivalence is defined by the `==` operator.\n\nThis corrected version is expected to function correctly for Dijkstra's algorithm as long as each node's `successors` method or property provides direct neighbors and `length_by_edge` provides the distance between each connected node pair."
