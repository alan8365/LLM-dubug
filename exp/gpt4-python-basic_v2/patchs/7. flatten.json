The correct method to flatten a nested list using a generator function in Python should therefore directly yield the elements which are not lists. Here's the corrected code:\n\n```python\ndef flatten(arr):\n    for x in arr:\n        if isinstance(x, list):  # Check if the element is a list\n            for y in flatten(x):  # If it is a list, recursively flatten it\n                yield y\n        else:\n            yield x  # If it's not a list, yield the element directly\n```\n\nNow the function properly yields individual non-list elements directly, and recursively flattens elements that are lists. This approach ensures that all elements are ultimately yielded as individual items, regardless of the depth of nesting in the original list."
