            "raw_code": "The provided code has a bug in how it calculates the elements of each row in Pascal's Triangle. The main issue is with the range for the inner loop and how it fills the `row` list. The last element of every row is absent because the loop ends too early, and it does not correctly add the last `1` to each row. \n\nHere's the corrected version of the function:\n\n```python\ndef pascal(n):\n    rows = [[1]]\n    for r in range(1, n):\n        row = [1]  # start each row with a 1\n        for c in range(1, r):\n            # Each element is the sum from the upper row, from previous and current index\n            upleft = rows[r - 1][c - 1]\n            upright = rows[r - 1][c]\n            row.append(upleft + upright)\n        row.append(1)  # end each row with a 1\n        rows.append(row)\n\n    return rows\n```\n\nExplanation of changes:\n1. **Initialization of Each Row**: Each row begins and ends with a 1. So, we initialize the `row` list with `[1]` instead of an empty list to handle the first element.\n2. **Inner Loop**: It iterates from `1` to `r`, avoiding the need to specifically handle the first column since we already have it in the row initialization.\n3. **End of Row Element**: After the loop, another `1` is appended to each row to handle the last element.\n\nThis fixed code will output the correct rows of Pascal's Triangle when given an input `n`."

            "raw_code": "The code provided is intended to generate Pascal's Triangle up to `n` rows, but it has a bug in the inner loop where it doesn't correctly add elements to form each row. The last element for each row, which should always be `1`, is not being added due to the range used in the loop. Here's the corrected code:\n\n```python\ndef pascal(n):\n    rows = [[1]]  # The first row, always starts with 1\n    for r in range(1, n):\n        row = [1]  # Each row starts with a 1\n        for c in range(1, r):  # Start from 1 as the first element is already added\n            # Calculate the new element as the sum of the two elements above it\n            element = rows[r - 1][c - 1] + rows[r - 1][c]\n            row.append(element)\n        row.append(1)  # Each row ends with a 1\n        rows.append(row)\n\n    return rows\n```\n\nExplanation:\n1. **Initialization**: The first row is initialized with `[1]`.\n2. **Outer Loop**: This iterates from `1` to `n-1` to generate each row.\n3. **First Element**: Each row is started by appending `1`, since the first element of every row in Pascal's Triangle is `1`.\n4. **Inner Loop**: Runs from `1` to `r-1` which is used to generate the elements from the second up to the second last by summing the two numbers directly above the current position.\n5. **Last Element**: After exiting the inner loop, another `1` is appended to each row, ensuring all rows both start and end with `1`.\n6. **Row Addition**: The complete row is added to the `rows` list.\n\nThis fix ensures that each row in the triangle is correctly formed with the appropriate number of elements and follows the properties of Pascal's Triangle."
