            "raw_code": "The provided code aims to implement a topological sort of a directed graph. The initial attempt in the code tries to find nodes with no incoming edges (sources) and then iteratively add nodes whose dependencies (nodes from which they have incoming edges) are already included in the ordered list. However, the logic used is buggy and inefficient, specifically in checking for ready nodes and ensuring all nodes are considered. Here's a corrected version:\n\n```python\ndef topological_ordering(nodes):\n    # Dictionary to keep count of incoming edges for each node\n    incoming_edge_count = {node: len(node.incoming_nodes) for node in nodes}\n    \n    # Initialize a list to serve as a queue for nodes with no incoming edges\n    queue = [node for node in nodes if incoming_edge_count[node] == 0]\n    ordered_nodes = []\n    \n    while queue:\n        # Pop from the front of the queue\n        current_node = queue.pop(0)\n        ordered_nodes.append(current_node)\n        \n        # Visit each adjacent node (nodes that current_node points to)\n        for nextnode in current_node.outgoing_nodes:\n            # Decrease the count of incoming edges\n            incoming_edge_count[nextnode] -= 1\n            \n            # If no more incoming edges, add to queue\n            if incoming_edge_count[nextnode] == 0:\n                queue.append(nextnode)\n    \n    # Checking for a cycle (if the graph had cycles, not all nodes will be in ordered_nodes)\n    if len(ordered_nodes) != len(nodes):\n        raise Exception(\"Graph has a cycle and cannot be topologically sorted.\")\n\n    return ordered_nodes\n```\n\n### Key Changes and Explanation:\n1. **Incoming Edges Count**: We maintain a dictionary `incoming_edge_count` to keep track of how many incoming edges each node has.\n2. **Queue for Sources**: We use a simple list `queue` to store nodes that currently have no incoming edges. Initially, this is populated with nodes that do not depend on any other nodes.\n3. **Processing Nodes**: Nodes are dequeued and their adjacent nodes (nodes they point to via `outgoing_nodes`) are checked. If the adjacent node\u2019s incoming edges drop to zero after removing the current node\u2019s edge, it\u2019s then added to the queue.\n4. **Cycle Detection**: After processing, if the size of `ordered_nodes` does not match the number of nodes provided, it indicates that some nodes were not processed due to cyclic dependencies, which makes topological sorting impossible.\n\nThis code handles graphs with cycles and uses an explicit queue for managing nodes, providing clarity and maintaining the principles of topological sorting. It performs in O(V + E) time complexity, where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges, aligning with the efficient implementation of topological sort algorithms."

However, there's a logic problem in how it processes and decides when to add nodes to the `ordered_nodes` list, along with performance concerns in checking node membership redundantly. Here is the fixed code:\n\n```python\ndef topological_ordering(nodes):\n    # Initialize the list for ordered nodes\n    ordered_nodes = []\n    # Find nodes with no incoming edges\n    nodes_with_no_incoming = [node for node in nodes if not node.incoming_nodes]\n\n    # Process nodes while there are nodes with no incoming edges\n    while nodes_with_no_incoming:\n        node = nodes_with_no_incoming.pop()\n        ordered_nodes.append(node)\n\n        # Update the incoming_nodes of each outgoing node and check for no incoming edges\n        temp_outgoing_nodes = list(node.outgoing_nodes)  # Copy to avoid modification issues during iteration\n        for nextnode in temp_outgoing_nodes:\n            # Remove the current node from the incoming nodes of the next node\n            nextnode.incoming_nodes.remove(node)\n            # If no more incoming nodes, add to the list for processing\n            if not nextnode.incoming_nodes:\n                nodes_with_no_incoming.append(nextnode)\n\n    # Check if there's a cycle\n    if len(ordered_nodes) != len(nodes):\n        raise Exception(\"There is at least one cycle in the graph\")\n\n    return ordered_nodes\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Initialization**: We start by finding all nodes that have no incoming edges. These nodes are eligible to start the ordering.\n\n2. **Processing Nodes Without Incoming Edges**: We continually process nodes that no longer have incoming edges. For each node processed, we:\n   - Add it to the `ordered_nodes` list as it's next in topological order.\n   - For each outgoing node from this current node, we remove this node from its list of `incoming_nodes`.\n   - If any of these outgoing nodes now have no incoming nodes, they're added to the list to be processed next.\n\n3. **Cycle Detection**: After processing, if the number of nodes in `ordered_nodes` doesn't match the original number of nodes, it indicates that there's a cycle in the graph (i.e., not all nodes could be processed which happens only if some nodes still have incoming edges; a sign of a cycle in a directed graph).\n\nThis approach uses Kahn's algorithm for topological sorting, which efficiently handles the direct dependencies and is also capable of detecting cycles."
