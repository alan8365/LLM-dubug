            "raw_code": "Here's the fixed version of the code. The main issue addressed is the incorrect order of operands when performing the operations from the stack. In Reverse Polish Notation (RPN), when an operator is encountered, the first operand comes from the second-to-last item pushed to the stack, and the second operand is from the last item pushed:\n\n```python\ndef rpn_eval(tokens):\n    def op(symbol, a, b):\n        return {\n            '+': lambda a, b: a + b,\n            '-': lambda a, b: a - b,\n            '*': lambda a, b: a * b,\n            '/': lambda a, b: a / b\n        }[symbol](a, b)\n\n    stack = []\n\n    for token in tokens:\n        if isinstance(token, float) or isinstance(token, int):  # Supported int type as well.\n            stack.append(token)\n        else:\n            b = stack.pop()  # Swap the order of popping to get the correct operands order.\n            a = stack.pop()\n            stack.append(\n                op(token, a, b)\n            )\n\n    return stack.pop()\n```\n\nChanges and explanations:\n1. **Operand Order**: I changed the order in which elements `a` and `b` are popped from the stack. In Reverse Polish Notation, the operator applies to the two most recent numbers, where the first number popped (b) is the right operand, and the second number popped (a) is the left operand.\n\n2. **Handling Integers**: Added support for integers by checking if the token is an instance of `int`. This ensures the code is more robust and can handle both integers and floats, which are typical in numerical computations.\n\n3. **Error Handling**: This code assumes the input is well-formed (correct RPN). In practice, you might want to add error checking for cases where improper input could lead to errors (like having more operators than operands or stack underflows).\n\nThis code is now corrected for handling basic Reverse Polish Notation calculations correctly with the typical operations. Make sure that the input `tokens` list contains either `float` or `int` numbers, and the valid operation symbols (`'+', '-', '*', '/'`)."

            "raw_code": "There is a primary issue in your RPN (Reverse Polish Notation) evaluation function related to the order of operands when popping them from the stack for a non-commutative operation (subtraction or division). In typical RPN, the second last popped item should be the left operand, and the last popped item should be the right operand. Let's correct the order of operands:\n\n```python\ndef rpn_eval(tokens):\n    def op(symbol, a, b):\n        return {\n            '+': lambda a, b: a + b,\n            '-': lambda a, b: a - b,\n            '*': lambda a, b: a * b,\n            '/': lambda a, b: a / b if b != 0 else float('inf')  # Handle division by zero case\n        }[symbol](a, b)\n\n    stack = []\n\n    for token in tokens:\n        if isinstance(token, float) or isinstance(token, int):\n            stack.append(token)\n        else:\n            b = stack.pop()  # Right operand\n            a = stack.pop()  # Left operand\n            result = op(token, a, b)\n            stack.append(result)\n\n    return stack.pop()\n```\n\n### Changes and Enhancements\n1. **Operand Order Fix:** I modified the order in which operands `a` and `b` are popped from the stack. In the original code, `a` was popped before `b`, which is incorrect for operations like subtraction and division since the operation is not commutative.\n2. **Handling Division by Zero:** Added handling for division by zero to avoid raising an exception. In this case, it returns `float('inf')`, but depending on the use case, you might want to manage it differently (e.g., raise an exception, error message, etc.).\n3. **Support for `int` Types:** The original condition `if isinstance(token, float)` was expanded to also check for `int` because numerical input could reasonably include integers.\n\nThese modifications should ensure that the function correctly evaluates expressions given in Reverse Polish Notation while handling some potential edge cases."

This enables handling expressions with both integers and floats.\n2. **Operand Order**: Fixed the order in which operands are popped off the stack. The second item popped (`b`) should be used as the second operand and the first item popped (`a`) as the first operand in the operation function.\n3. **Testing**: A simple RPN expression example is provided to demonstrate how the fixed function works.\n\nThis corrected version should now handle basic RPN calculations correctly, taking into account the specific needs of operand ordering in operations."
