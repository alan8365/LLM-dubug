            "raw_code": "The code you provided is a function for wrapping text into a given number of columns. There is a logical bug in how the text is being extracted and how the remainder is handled, especially when a suitable space cannot be found within the limit and the word is too long. The function also fails to handle the final chunk of text if its length is less than or equal to `cols`, as it does not append this remaining text to `lines`.\n\nHere is the corrected version of the function:\n```python\ndef wrap(text, cols):\n    lines = []\n    while len(text) > cols:\n        end = text.rfind(' ', 0, cols + 1)\n        if end == -1:\n            end = cols\n        line, text = text[:end], text[end:].lstrip()  # Strip the leading space if breaking on a space\n        lines.append(line)\n    lines.append(text)  # Append the remainder of the text\n    return lines\n```\n\n### Changes Made:\n1. **Stripping leading whitespace:** After breaking the text into `line` and `text`, `text` is stripped of leading whitespace using `.lstrip()`. This corrects the issue where the function was previously retaining the leading spaces after each line break, leading to incorrect indexing for subsequent iterations.\n   \n2. **Appending remaining text:** After the loop, whatever is left in `text` (text shorter than or equal to `cols` characters) is appended to the list `lines`. This ensures that all parts of the original text are included.\n\nWith these corrections, the function can now properly wrap the input text into lines without exceeding the specified number of columns, respecting word boundaries when possible and handling edge cases appropriately."

However, the existing code has a few issues that need to be addressed for it to function as expected. The primary problems are:\n1. The function does not handle the remaining part of the text that is shorter than or equal to `cols` length after the loop.\n2. The function can go into an infinite loop if `end` becomes `0` (i.e., when there is no space character in the first `cols+1` characters of `text`).\n\nHere is the corrected version of the code:\n\n```python\ndef wrap(text, cols):\n    lines = []\n    while len(text) > cols:\n        # Search for the last space within the permitted range\n        end = text.rfind(' ', 0, cols + 1)\n        \n        # If no space is found in the range and the remaining text is longer than cols\n        if end == -1 and len(text) > cols:\n            end = cols  # Force a break at cols\n        elif end == -1:\n            end = len(text)  # Use the length of the remaining text\n        \n        line, text = text[:end], text[end:].lstrip()  # Split and remove leading whitespace from remaining text\n        lines.append(line)\n\n    # Append the last piece of text if it's not empty after looping (for text with length <= cols)\n    if text:\n        lines.append(text)\n\n    return lines\n```\nThis adjusted function includes:\n1. An improvement to handle the remaining text that is less than or equal to `cols`.\n2. A check to ensure that `text` is stripped of leading spaces when the next segment begins. This helps in situations where a whole word is moved to the next line.\n3. A condition to handle edge cases where no spaces exist within the first `cols` characters.\n\nNow, this function can be used to wrap text at specified column widths properly, handling the edge cases and avoiding infinite loops."

However, there are a few issues in the original implementation:\n\n1. The while-loop continues processing until `len(text) > cols` which omits adding the last part of `text` to `lines` if it's shorter than `cols`.\n2. After extracting `line` using `text[:end]`, if `end` points to a space, `text[end:]` will start with that space on the next line.\n\nHere's the corrected version of the function with explanations:\n\n```python\ndef wrap(text, cols):\n    lines = []\n    while len(text) > cols:\n        # Find the last space within the first `cols + 1` characters\n        end = text.rfind(' ', 0, cols + 1)\n        if end == -1:\n            # If no space, force break at `cols`\n            end = cols\n        else:\n            # Correct end to not include the space at the start of the next line\n            end = end + 1\n        \n        line, text = text[:end].strip(), text[end:].strip()\n        lines.append(line)\n\n    # Append remaining text if any\n    if text:\n        lines.append(text)\n\n    return lines\n```\n\n### Changes and Improvements:\n\n- **Whitespace Management**: Added `.strip()` to remove leading or trailing whitespace which can occur when slicing at space boundaries.\n- **Final Line Addition**: After the while-loop, we check if there's any remaining `text` that is less than or equal to `cols` in length and add it to `lines`.\n- **Handling a Line Break at a Space**: Adjusted the slicing by adding `end = end + 1` after ensuring there's a space, to avoid starting the next line with a space.\n\nThese fixes ensure that all the text is wrapped correctly according to the specified `cols`, and lines are broken at spaces when possible without starting or ending with unwanted spaces."
