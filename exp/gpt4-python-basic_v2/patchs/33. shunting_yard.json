This would prevent operators from being included in the final RPN expression.\n\n2. **Handling of Remaining Operators after Last Token**:\n   - At the end of processing all input tokens, all remaining operators on the `opstack` should be moved to `rpntokens`. The original implementation correctly handled this.\n\nBy implementing these corrections, the `shunting_yard` function should now correctly parse tokens, handle their precedence, and output a correct RPN expression."
