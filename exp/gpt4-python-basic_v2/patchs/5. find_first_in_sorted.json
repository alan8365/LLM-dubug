            "raw_code": "The code you've provided is meant to find the first occurrence of an element `x` in a sorted array `arr`. However, there's a bug in the implementation related to the binary search loop's conditions and array index access. Let's address those issues and provide the corrected version:\n\n1. **Bounds Check**: When updating `hi`, it should be set to `mid - 1` instead of just `mid` in the binary search, to avoid an infinite loop. This will ensure that the search space is reduced correctly in each iteration.\n2. **Lo-Hi Condition**: The loop condition should be `while lo < hi` instead of `while lo <= hi`. This is because we deal with `lo` and `hi` differently in the loop, closing in around the target without having them overlapping incorrectly, which could lead to accessing array indices that are out of bounds when computing `mid`.\n\nHere is the corrected implementation:\n\n```python\ndef find_first_in_sorted(arr, x):\n    lo = 0\n    hi = len(arr) - 1\n\n    while lo < hi:\n        mid = (lo + hi) // 2\n        \n        if x > arr[mid]:\n            lo = mid + 1\n        else:\n            hi = mid\n    \n    # After the loop, check if lo is on the correct element\n    if lo == len(arr) or arr[lo] != x:\n        return -1\n    return lo\n```\n\nThis corrected function uses a standard binary search approach to narrow down the search space and then checks if the element at the final index `lo` is the target `x`. If `lo` goes out of the bounds of the array or the element at `lo` is not `x`, it returns `-1`. Otherwise, it returns `lo`, which should have the first occurrence of `x` if `x` exists in `arr`.\n\nThis implementation should work correctly for all cases in a sorted array, including arrays with duplicates, without any element, or when `x` is not present in the array."

            "raw_code": "The code provided has a bug related to the calculation of the boundaries of the binary search, particularly with how the `hi` index is adjusted within the loop. The condition to adjust `hi` should properly reduce it by one (`hi = mid - 1`) when shifting the upper boundary. Moreover, there seems to be an infinite loop possibility with the wrong `hi` assignment (`hi = mid` instead of `hi = mid - 1`). Additionally, the termination condition of the while loop should be `while lo < hi`, to prevent accessing an out-of-range index, especially when `lo` equals `hi`.\n\nHere\u2019s the corrected version of the code:\n```python\ndef find_first_in_sorted(arr, x):\n    lo = 0\n    hi = len(arr) - 1  # Adjust to point to the last index of the array\n\n    while lo <= hi:  # Ensure that lo can equal hi to test the middle value when down to one element\n        mid = (lo + hi) // 2\n\n        if x == arr[mid] and (mid == 0 or x != arr[mid - 1]):\n            return mid\n\n        elif x <= arr[mid]:\n            hi = mid - 1  # Correctly adjust hi to avoid infinite loop\n\n        else:\n            lo = mid + 1\n\n    return -1\n```\n\nThis fixed version ensures that the `hi` variable is correctly adjusted by subtracting 1 when narrowing the upper half of the search range. Additionally, the while loop condition ensures that the search space is appropriately narrowed down, preventing an infinite loop and ensuring the algorithm always progresses towards the base case."
