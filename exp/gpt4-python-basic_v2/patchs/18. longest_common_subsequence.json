            "raw_code": "The code provided for finding the longest common subsequence (LCS) has a logical error in the case where the characters at the current position in both strings `a` and `b` are the same. Specifically, the recursion does not correctly reduce the `b` string after a match, causing infinite recursion in certain cases. Moreover, the function could be optimized to handle repeated subproblems more efficiently.\n\nHere is the corrected and optimized code using memoization:\n\n```python\ndef longest_common_subsequence(a, b):\n    # Memoization cache\n    memo = {}\n\n    def lcs_recursive(i, j):\n        if (i, j) in memo:\n            return memo[(i, j)]\n        if i == len(a) or j == len(b):\n            result = ''\n        elif a[i] == b[j]:\n            result = a[i] + lcs_recursive(i + 1, j + 1)\n        else:\n            result = max(lcs_recursive(i, j + 1), lcs_recursive(i + 1, j), key=len)\n        memo[(i, j)] = result\n        return result\n\n    return lcs_recursive(0, 0)\n\n# Example usage\na = \"AGGTAB\"\nb = \"GXTXAYB\"\nprint(longest_common_subsequence(a, b))  # Outputs: \"GTAB\"\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Memoization**: This is used to store the results of computed subproblems `(i, j)` in a dictionary called `memo`, where `i` and `j` are the current indices in strings `a` and `b`, respectively. This avoids the redundant recomputation of the LCS for the same subproblems, significantly improving the performance.\n\n2. **Recursive Function `lcs_recursive`**: This function is defined within `longest_common_subsequence` and takes indices `i` and `j`. It works by checking base cases (like when indices go out of bounds of their respective strings). If the characters at `i` and `j` in `a` and `b` match, it includes that character in the LCS and moves both indices forward. If they don't match, it branches into two calls\u2014one excluding the current character from `a` and the other excluding the current character from `b`, and then selects the longer sequence between them.\n\n3. **Base Case**: The function terminates when either index reaches the end of its respective string (`i == len(a)` or `j == len(b)`), returning an empty string in such cases.\n\nBy employing memoization, the time complexity is reduced significantly from exponential to polynomial (O(len(a) * len(b)) time complexity), making this approach feasible for larger inputs.\n"

The buggy part is in the line where both strings are advanced even if just the first characters match, but the recursion does not account for matching the rest of the characters in both strings. Here's the corrected code:\n\n```python\ndef longest_common_subsequence(a, b):\n    if not a or not b:\n        return ''\n\n    elif a[0] == b[0]:\n        return a[0] + longest_common_subsequence(a[1:], b[1:])  # Fix: advance both strings\n\n    else:\n        return max(\n            longest_common_subsequence(a, b[1:]),\n            longest_common_subsequence(a[1:], b),\n            key=len\n        )\n```\n\nChanges made:\n- When `a[0] == b[0]`, both `a` and `b` should be advanced by removing the first character (`a[1:]` and `b[1:]`). This ensures that we are checking subsequences from both strings starting right after the matching characters. \n\nThis corrected implementation ensures proper recursion for subsequences after a match, thereby effectively building the longest common subsequence."
