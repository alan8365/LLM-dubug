This would throw an `AttributeError` if `hare` or `hare.successor` was `None`.\n\n- The corrected condition in the `while` loop now checks if `hare` is `None` or if `hare.successor` is `None`. This ensures that the code doesn't try to access `hare.successor.successor` if `hare` or `hare.successor` is `None`, preventing the `AttributeError`."
