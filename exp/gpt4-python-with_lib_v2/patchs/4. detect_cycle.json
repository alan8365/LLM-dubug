Additionally, it doesn't handle the case where a Node's `successor` is `None`. Here is the revised code:\n\n```python\ndef detect_cycle(node):\n    if node is None:\n        return False\n\n    hare = node.successor\n    tortoise = node\n    \n    while hare is not None and hare.successor is not None:\n        tortoise = tortoise.successor\n        hare = hare.successor.successor \n\n        if hare is tortoise:\n            return True\n\n    return False\n```  \n\nThis revised code first checks if the node is `None`. If it is, it returns `False` as a `None` node doesn't form a cycle. Then it checks the `successor` of the `hare` node. If it or its successor is `None`, it breaks the loop and returns `False` indicating there is no cycle. If the `hare` and `tortoise` point to the same node at any point, it returns `True` indicating a cycle is present."

The `return False` statement is also put outside the `while` loop because when there is no cycle, the loop will break and the function should return `False`.
