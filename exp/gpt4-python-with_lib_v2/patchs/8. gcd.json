The bug in the original code was that the arguments in the recursive call were in the wrong order. In the correct implementation, as shown in the revised code, the second argument for the recursive call should be the remainder of `a` divided by `b`(i.e., `a % b`). Instead, `b` was being passed as the second argument, which was causing the function to loop indefinitely for some inputs."
