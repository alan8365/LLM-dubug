In the original line `heap = arr[:k]`, the slice of the array should have been `k+1` elements long. The heap initial size should be equal to k in order to generate k smallest values from the array.\n\n2. In the original line `for x in arr:`, it should have been `for x in arr[k+1:]:`. We need to consider elements after the initial k-elements, as we already added first `k+1` elements to the heap. The original loop was incorrect because it included the elements that were already part of the heap."
