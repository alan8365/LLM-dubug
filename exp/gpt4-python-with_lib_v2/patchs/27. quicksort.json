If the list is empty, return an empty list. \n2. Choose a pivot element from the list (in this case, the first element is chosen).\n3. Create two lists: one with elements less than the pivot and one with elements greater than the pivot. \n4. Recursively apply quicksort to these two lists. \n5. Concatenate the sorted list of elements less than the pivot, the pivot, and the sorted list of elements greater than the pivot. This forms the sorted list.\n\nIf the code isn't working as expected, it's possible that the issue is elsewhere in your program, or your expectations of what the code should do don't match what it's designed to do. Quicksort is a comparison sort and it does not handle duplicate elements in the original list. If your list contains duplicates, you need to modify the algorithm.\n\nHere is quicksort that handles duplicates:\n```python\ndef quicksort(arr):\n    if not arr:\n        return []\n\n    pivot = arr[0]\n    lesser = quicksort([x for x in arr[1:] if x < pivot])\n    equal = [x for x in arr if x == pivot]\n    greater = quicksort([x for x in arr[1:] if x > pivot])\n    return lesser + equal + greater\n```"
