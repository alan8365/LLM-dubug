Added a dictionary `shortest_distances` to keep track of minimum distances to each node from startnode. \n2. Removed `get` and `insert_or_update` functions as they were not needed and were potentially causing problems. The heap structure of unvisited_nodes is maintained by `heappush` and `heappop` functions from `heapq` module.\n3. Added a check to skip visited nodes in main loop.\n4. Updated the logic for updating the distances of the nodes in the unvisited_nodes heap."

In the while loop inside the shortest_path_length function, the node comparison should be done using the equality operator, not the `is` operator, which checks for identity (i.e., whether two variables are pointing to the same object), not equality.\n\n2. The logic to update the distance in unvisited_nodes was incorrect. The new distance should be the sum of the current distance and the length of the edge to the next node, and you should check if this new distance is less than the current distance to the next node in the heap.\n\n3. In the insert_or_update function, when a node's distance is updated in the heap, the heap property is not maintained. You need to call the heapify function to re-establish the heap property.\n\n4. The get function should return None if the node is not found, not 0. Because 0 is a valid distance, returning 0 can lead to confusion."
