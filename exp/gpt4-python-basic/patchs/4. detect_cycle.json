If the input node is None, return False since a None node can't create a cycle.\n- The condition for the while loop is changed. It should run only when hare and hare.successor are not None. Before it only checked hare.successor which could cause a NoneType error when accessing hare.successor.successor if hare.successor was None.\n- Finally, at the end it returns False, which means that when the loop ends without finding any cycles, it will assume there are no cycles. Before it would continue looping indefinitely if no cycle was detected."
