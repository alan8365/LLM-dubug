This will grant an O(1) access time when getting and updating distances.\n- For the adjacency matrix `length_by_edge`, assumed it is a dictionary of dictionaries where each key is a node and the value is a dictionary of adjacent nodes with the value being the length of the edge.\n- Fixed the condition inside the `if` statement where it's comparing if a node is the goal node. In Python, using `is` checks for object identity (same object in memory), not if they have the same value. So, it should be `==` not `is`.\n- Adding nodes to `visited_nodes` only once it's removed from the heap. This guarantees that once a node is added to visited nodes, we've already found the shortest path to it. This is because the heap always returns the smallest distance.\n- Updating `unvisited_nodes` heap only when the new distance to a node is shorter than the current shortest known distance."

Removed `insert_or_update()` and `get()`, replacing them with a dictionary that holds the minimum distance to each node. This is because the heap is not an appropriate data structure for updating or retrieving values based on the nodes (which served as keys in this context). \n2. Accounted for the fact that `length_by_edge[node]` should give a dictionary of `{nextnode: edge_length}` pairs. The original code seemed to treat it as a list of `nextnode` nodes. \n3. Changed `node is goalnode` to `node == goalnode` to ensure value equality instead of object identity. \n4. Made comments more accurate and clear."

Here are the changes required:\n\n1. We changed the 'is' operator to the '==' operator for checking node equality. The 'is' operator checks identity (whether two references refer to the same object), not equality.\n\n2. We removed the insert_or_update and get functions because they are unnecessary and inefficient. Instead, we used a dictionary (distances) to keep track of the shortest known distance from startnode to each node.\n\n3. In the original code, visited nodes could be revisited with longer paths. We fixed this by checking whether each node has been visited before considering its successors.\n\n4. We updated the calculation of new_distance to correctly use the current node's distance and the length of the edge to the next node.\n\n5. We simplified the code by directly pushing new nodes onto the heap. The heap property is maintained by the heappush function."
