Here's the updated code:\n\n```python\ndef powerset(arr):\n    if arr:\n        first, *rest = arr \n        rest_subsets = powerset(rest)\n        if rest_subsets is not None:\n            return [[first] + subset for subset in rest_subsets]\n        else:\n            return None\n    else:\n        return [[]]\n```\n\nThis change ensures that if `rest_subsets` is `None`, then `None` is returned from the function instead of trying to iterate over it."
