To fix this issue, the code should add a check to ignore paths with cycles.\n\n### Patch\n\nTo fix the code, we can replace the code in line 12 with the following:\n\n```python\nif length_by_path[i, k] + length_by_path[j, k] < length_by_path[i, j]:\n    length_by_path[i, j] = length_by_path[i, k] + length_by_path[j, k]\n```\nThis change will add a check to ensure that the new path length is shorter than the current path length before updating it, effectively ignoring paths with cycles.\n\n### Complete code with patch applied\n\n```python=\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef shortest_path_lengths(n, length_by_edge):\n    length_by_path = defaultdict(lambda: float('inf'))\n    length_by_path.update({(i, i): 0 for i in range(n)})\n    length_by_path.update(length_by_edge)\n\n    for k in range(n):\n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(n):\n                if length_by_path[i, k] + length_by_path[j, k] < length_by_path[i, j]:\n                    length_by_path[i, j] = length_by_path[i, k] + length_by_path[j, k]\n\n    return length_by_path\n\n\n\n\n```"
