            "raw_code": "The issue in the code is with the line:\n```python=\nwhile abs(x - approx) > epsilon:\n```\nThis line checks if the absolute difference between `x` and `approx` is greater than `epsilon`, which is used as a tolerance level. However, `approx` is initially set to `x / 2`, so this condition can lead to an infinite loop if `x` is small (close to zero). \n\nTo fix this issue, the initial approximation should be set to a more reasonable value. A common approach is to use `x / 2` as the initial approximation only if `x` is greater than or equal to 1. Otherwise, the initial approximation should be set to `x * 2`, which is scaled up to ensure a more suitable initial approximation.\n\n```python=\ndef sqrt(x, epsilon):\n    approx = x / 2\n    if x >= 1:\n        approx = x / 2\n    else:\n        approx = x * 2\n    while abs(x - approx * approx) > epsilon:\n        approx = 0.5 * (approx + x / approx)\n    return approx\n```\nIn this corrected version, the condition in the while loop is updated to use `approx * approx` to compare against `x` instead of `x - approx`. This is because we are interested in finding the square root, which is `approx * approx`, not the absolute difference between `x` and `approx`."
