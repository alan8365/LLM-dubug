The original condition `if weight < j` was incorrect because it meant that the item could only be included in the knapsack if its weight was strictly less than the remaining capacity. However, in the knapsack problem, it's possible to include items that exactly fit the remaining capacity.\n\n2. The corrected condition `if weight <= j` allows items to be included in the knapsack if their weight is less than or equal to the remaining capacity. This ensures that items that fit exactly in the knapsack are considered as well."
