The following line should be replaced with:\n```python=\nweight_by_node[v] = min(weight_by_node[u] + weight, weight_by_node[v])\n```\n2. The second issue in the code is that it doesn't handle negative weights correctly. If there is a negative weight cycle in the graph, the algorithm will never terminate. To fix this, we can add a check for negative weights before updating the `weight_by_node` dictionary:\n```python=\nif weight_by_node[u] + weight < weight_by_node[v]:\n    weight_by_node[v] = weight_by_node[u] + weight\n```\n3. A third issue is that the code doesn't consider the case where the graph is disconnected. If the source node is not connected to all the other nodes in the graph, the algorithm will not find the shortest paths to all the nodes. To fix this, we can add a check for disconnected nodes before returning the `weight_by_node` dictionary:\n```python=\nif len(weight_by_node) != len(weight_by_edge):\n    return None  # The graph is disconnected\n```\nHere is the corrected code:\n```python=\ndef shortest_paths(source, weight_by_edge):\n    weight_by_node = {\n        v: float('inf') for u, v in weight_by_edge\n    }\n    weight_by_node[source] = 0\n\n    for i in range(len(weight_by_node) - 1):\n        for (u, v), weight in weight_by_edge.items():\n            if weight_by_node[u] + weight < weight_by_node[v]:\n                weight_by_node[v] = weight_by_node[u] + weight\n\n    if len(weight_by_node) != len(weight_by_edge):\n        return None  # The graph is disconnected\n\n    return weight_by_node\n```"
