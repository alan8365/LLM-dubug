If there is any remaining text, it is appended to the `lines` list.\n\nWith these changes, the code should now correctly wrap the text into lines of the specified width."

However, the code has a bug when there are no spaces within `cols` characters from the beginning of the string. To fix this, we need to check if `end` is equal to -1 before using it to slice the string. The corrected code below:\n\n```python\ndef wrap(text, cols):\n    lines = []\n    while len(text) > cols:\n        end = text.rfind(' ', 0, cols + 1)\n        if end == -1:\n            end = cols\n        else:\n            end += 1 # Move past the space\n        line, text = text[:end], text[end:]\n        lines.append(line)\n\n    return lines\n```\nWith this correction, the code will now handle cases where there are no spaces within `cols` characters from the beginning of the string by simply splitting the string at `cols` characters."

We add a new condition at the end of the loop: `if text:`. This condition checks if there is any remaining text after the last line break.\n2. If there is remaining text (i.e., `text` is not empty), we append it to the `lines` list.\n3. Finally, we return the `lines` list, which contains all the wrapped lines of text."
