Missing argument.** The `shortest_path_lengths` function expects two arguments: `n` and `length_by_edge`. However, only `n` is being passed in the example usage. Add the missing `length_by_edge` argument:\n```python\nlength_by_path = shortest_path_lengths(n, length_by_edge)\n```\n\n**3. Incorrect use of `update`.** The `update` method is used to add multiple key-value pairs to a dictionary. However, the code is trying to add a single key-value pair using `update`. Correct the code to:\n```python\nlength_by_path[i, j] = min(\n    length_by_path[i, j],\n    length_by_path[i, k] + length_by_path[k, j]\n)\n```\n\n**4. Unbound variable.** The `shortest_path_lengths` function does not define the `length_by_edge` variable. Add the `length_by_edge` argument to the function definition:\n```python\ndef shortest_path_lengths(n, length_by_edge):\n    # ...\n```\n\nAfter making these corrections, the code should work properly to calculate the shortest path lengths between all pairs of nodes in a graph."
