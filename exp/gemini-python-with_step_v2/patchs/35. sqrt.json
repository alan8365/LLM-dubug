            "raw_code": "The bug in the code is that `approx` is initially set to `x/2`, which can be a poor approximation for the square root of `x`, especially when `x` is large. This can lead to slow convergence or even divergence.\n\nTo fix this bug, `approx` should be initialized to a better initial guess. A common choice is to use the Babylonian method, which starts with `approx = x` and then iteratively refines the approximation using the formula `approx = 0.5 * (approx + x / approx)`.\n\nHere is the corrected code:\n```python\ndef sqrt(x, epsilon):\n    approx = x\n    while abs(x - approx) > epsilon:\n        approx = 0.5 * (approx + x / approx)\n    return approx\n```"

Instead, we can use `1` as the initial `approx` value.\n\n```python\ndef sqrt(x, epsilon):\n    approx = 1\n    while abs(x - approx) > epsilon:\n        approx = 0.5 * (approx + x / approx)\n    return approx\n```\n\n2. **Handling Special Cases**:\nAdd checks to handle special cases, such as non-positive inputs and 0 epsilon.\n\n```python\ndef sqrt(x, epsilon):\n    if x <= 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Input must be a positive number.\")\n    if epsilon <= 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Epsilon must be a positive number.\")\n\n    approx = 1\n    while abs(x - approx) > epsilon:\n        approx = 0.5 * (approx + x / approx)\n    return approx\n```\n\n3. **Avoid infinite loop for perfect squares**:\n If `x` is a perfect square, the while loop will never terminate. To avoid this, check if the `approx` is close enough to `x` (within `epsilon`) and return it if so.\n\n```python\ndef sqrt(x, epsilon):\n    if x <= 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Input must be a positive number.\")\n    if epsilon <= 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Epsilon must be a positive number.\")\n\n    approx = 1\n    while abs(x - approx) > epsilon and abs(x - approx * approx) > epsilon:\n        approx = 0.5 * (approx + x / approx)\n    return approx\n```\n\n4. **Convergence Check**:\nThe convergence check should also consider the case where `approx` is very close to 0. If `approx` is too close to 0, division by `approx` may lead to numerical instability. To handle this, we can add a check to ensure that `approx` is not too small.\n\n```python\ndef sqrt(x, epsilon):\n    if x <= 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Input must be a positive number.\")\n    if epsilon <= 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Epsilon must be a positive number.\")\n\n    approx = 1\n    while abs(x - approx) > epsilon and abs(x - approx * approx) > epsilon and approx > epsilon:\n        approx = 0.5 * (approx + x / approx)\n    return approx\n```\n\n5. **Alternate Initial Approximation**:\nFor faster convergence, especially for large values of `x`, we can use a more sophisticated initial approximation. Here's one option:\n\n```python\ndef sqrt(x, epsilon):\n    if x <= 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Input must be a positive number.\")\n    if epsilon <= 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Epsilon must be a positive number.\")\n\n    if x >= 1:\n        approx = x / 2\n    else:\n        approx = 1\n\n    while abs(x - approx) > epsilon and abs(x - approx * approx) > epsilon and approx > epsilon:\n        approx = 0.5 * (approx + x / approx)\n    return approx\n```"

The issue here is that the initial value of `approx` is `x / 2`, which could be a very big value if `x` is large. This can lead to overflow errors. To fix this, we can initialize `approx` with a smaller value, such as `1`.\n\n### Step 2\n\n```python=\ndef sqrt(x, epsilon):\n    approx = 1\n    while abs(x - approx) > epsilon:\n        approx = 0.5 * (approx + x / approx)\n    return approx\n```\nThe issue here is that the code does not check if `x` is negative. If `x` is negative, the code will try to compute the square root of a negative number, which is not a real number. To fix this, we can check if `x` is negative and return `None` if it is.\n\n```python=\ndef sqrt(x, epsilon):\n    # Check if x is negative\n    if x < 0:\n        return None\n    approx = 1\n    while abs(x - approx) > epsilon:\n        approx = 0.5 * (approx + x / approx)\n    return approx\n```\n\n### The complete fixed code should look like this:\n```python=\ndef sqrt(x, epsilon):\n    # Check if x is negative\n    if x < 0:\n        return None\n    approx = 1\n    while abs(x - approx) > epsilon:\n        approx = 0.5 * (approx + x / approx)\n    return approx\n```"
