            "raw_code": "**Bug 1**: The code attempts to use `.extend()` on the generator expression, which is incorrect since `.extend()` expects a list or a sequence of items. To fix this, we can convert the generator expression to a list using `list()` before passing it to `.extend()`.\n```python=\nqueue.extend(list(node for node in node.successors if node not in nodesseen))\n```\n\n**Bug 2**: The code assumes that each node has a single successor, which may not always be the case. To fix this, the code should loop over `node.successors` and add each successor to the `queue`.\n```python=\nfor node in node.successors:\n    if node not in nodesseen:\n        queue.append(node)\n```\n\n**Bug 3**: The code's goal seems to be to find a path from `startnode` to `goalnode` in a graph. However, it doesn't return the path but rather just a boolean indicating whether a path exists. To fix this, the code should maintain a list of the nodes visited during the search and return it if the `goalnode` is reached.\n```python=\nimport copy\n\ndef breadth_first_search(startnode, goalnode):\n    queue = Queue()\n    queue.append([startnode])\n\n    nodesseen = set()\n    nodesseen.add(startnode)\n\n    while queue:\n        path = queue.popleft()\n        node = path[-1]\n\n        if node is goalnode:\n            return path\n        else:\n            for n in node.successors:\n                if n not in nodesseen:\n                    newpath = copy.deepcopy(path)\n                    newpath.append(n)\n                    queue.append(newpath)\n                    nodesseen.add(n)\n\n    return None\n```"
