In this case, `hare.successor` would be `None`, which would incorrectly cause the function to return `False`.\n\nTo fix this, we need to check for two conditions:\n1. If `hare.successor` is `None`, indicating that the end of the linked list is reached.\n2. If `tortoise` is equal to `hare`, indicating that the cycle has been detected.\n\nThe corrected code is as follows:\n```python=\ndef detect_cycle(node):\n    hare = tortoise = node\n\n    while True:\n        if hare.successor is None or tortoise is hare:\n            return False\n\n        tortoise = tortoise.successor\n        hare = hare.successor.successor\n\n        if hare is tortoise:\n            return True\n```\nWith this correction, the function will correctly detect cycles in the linked list and return `False` if there are no cycles."
