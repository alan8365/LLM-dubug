The issue is with the recursive calls to the `hanoi` function.\n\nIn the recursive calls, the parameters `start` and `end` are swapped. This is incorrect as it doesn't follow the Tower of Hanoi algorithm.\n\nIn the Tower of Hanoi algorithm, the goal is to move all the disks from the `start` peg to the `end` peg, using an intermediate `helper` peg.\n\nTherefore, In the first recursive call `hanoi(height - 1, start, helper)`, the parameter `start` should be the peg where the disks are currently located, `height - 1` should be the updated height after moving one disk, and `helper` should be the peg that will be used as the intermediate peg.\n\nSimilarly, in the second recursive call `hanoi(height - 1, helper, end)`, the parameter `helper` should be the peg where the disks are currently located, `height - 1` should be the updated height after moving one disk, and `end` should be the peg where the disks will be moved to.\n\nHere's the corrected code:\n\n```python\ndef hanoi(height, start=1, end=3):\n    steps = []\n    if height > 0:\n        helper = ({1, 2, 3} - {start} - {end}).pop()\n        steps.extend(hanoi(height - 1, start, helper))\n        steps.append((start, helper))\n        steps.extend(hanoi(height - 1, helper, end))\n\n    return steps\n```\nNow, the `hanoi` function correctly follows the Tower of Hanoi algorithm and calculates the steps required to move the disks from the `start` peg to the `end` peg using the `helper` peg."
