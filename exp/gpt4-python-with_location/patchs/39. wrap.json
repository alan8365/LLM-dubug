            "raw_code": "The bug in the code is that it doesn't handle the remaining part of the text that is less than or equal to the `cols` variable after the while loop terminates. The final portion of the text needs to be added to the `lines` list. Additionally, if `end` is not -1, the text needs to be split precisely at `end + 1` to move past the space (if the split is done at a space), rather than splitting exactly at `end` and thus potentially appending the leading space to the beginning of the next line.\n\nHere's the corrected code:\n\n```python\ndef wrap(text, cols):\n    lines = []\n    while len(text) > cols:\n        end = text.rfind(' ', 0, cols)\n        if end == -1:\n            end = cols\n        else:\n            end += 1  # Move past the space for the next line\n        line, text = text[:end].rstrip(), text[end:].lstrip()  # Trim any leading/trailing whitespace\n        lines.append(line)\n    lines.append(text)  # Add the remaining text to lines\n    return lines\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. I updated `text.rfind(' ', 0, cols)` to find space until `cols` instead of `cols + 1` because if a space is exactly at position `cols + 1`, it overshoots the allowed width by including additional characters that should actually start on the next line.\n  \n2. I added an `else` block to increment `end` by 1, moving past the found space and avoiding leading spaces on the next line of text.\n\n3. I use `rstrip()` and `lstrip()` when slicing the `text` to remove any unwanted leading or trailing spaces from the lines to ensure that there are no formatting issues with extra spaces.\n\n4. Finally, I appended the remaining `text` to `lines` after the loop finishes. This ensures that text shorter than or equal to `cols` or left after the last space that is less than `cols` isn't lost.\n\nThis modification handles all parts of the text and maintains a clean format in the resulting list of lines."

            "raw_code": "The bug in this code is in the manner in which the remainder of the `text` string is handled once it no longer exceeds the specified `cols` in length. The code currently does not include the final piece of `text` (which is shorter than the `cols` limit) in the `lines` list, hence missing data.\n\nTo fix this, you should append the remaining part of `text` to the `lines` list outside of the loop once it becomes shorter than or equal to `cols`. Here's the corrected code with this amendment:\n\n```python\ndef wrap(text, cols):\n    lines = []\n    while len(text) > cols:\n        end = text.rfind(' ', 0, cols + 1)\n        if end == -1:\n            end = cols\n        line, text = text[:end], text[end:].lstrip()  # Also added lstrip() to remove leading whitespaces\n        lines.append(line)\n\n    # Append the rest of the text which is shorter than cols\n    if text:\n        lines.append(text)\n\n    return lines\n```\n\nIn this corrected version:\n- **`text[end:].lstrip()`** is used to remove any leading whitespace resulting from the slicing of text, ensuring that the next substring does not start with unwanted spaces.\n- **`if text:`** is used to check if there's any remaining text (which will invariably be less than or equal to `cols` in length) that needs to be appended to the lines list after exiting the loop. \n\nThis guarantees that all parts of the original `text` string are included in the output, appropriately wrapped to the specified column width."

            "raw_code": "The bug in the code you provided is that it doesn't consider trimming the whitespace when slicing the `text` to form `line`. As a result, when `text` is split, leading spaces can be left at the beginning of the next line, which is usually undesirable for text wrapping. Additionally, the code does not handle appending the last chunk of `text` to the `lines` list when the loop terminates. This means any text shorter than `cols` or remaining after the last wrap will be omitted, which is another critical issue.\n\nHere's the revised version of the function with the bug fixed and behavior explained:\n\n```python\ndef wrap(text, cols):\n    lines = []\n    while len(text) > cols:\n        # Find the last space within the first `cols + 1` characters\n        end = text.rfind(' ', 0, cols + 1)\n        if end == -1:\n            # If no space found, force break the text at `cols`\n            end = cols\n        else:\n            # Increment `end` to avoid leading space on next line\n            end += 1\n        \n        # Extract the line and remove it from the text\n        line, text = text[:end].rstrip(), text[end:].lstrip()\n        lines.append(line)\n    \n    # Append the last part of the text if any remains\n    if text:\n        lines.append(text.strip())\n    \n    return lines\n```\n\n### Changes Made:\n1. **Whitespace Trimming**: Added `.strip()`, `.rstrip()`, and `.lstrip()` methods to ensure that the returned lines do not have unwanted leading or trailing whitespace.\n2. **Handling the End of Text**: After the while loop, we now check if there is any remaining text that is shorter than `cols` and append it to the lines list.\n\nThis revision ensures that the function behaves correctly by:\n- Not leaving leading whitespaces on any line.\n- Appropriately wrapping the text to the specified column width.\n- Including the final substring of the original text that's shorter than the specified column width."
