            "raw_code": "The bug in your function lies in the loop where elements for a new row of Pascal's triangle are computed. Specifically, the range of the inner loop for `c` is off, causing the last element of the row to be missing.\n\nEach new row in Pascal's triangle contains one more element than the last row. That is, if the previous row has `r` elements, the new row should have `r + 1` elements. Here\u2019s how you can correct your function:\n\n```python\ndef pascal(n):\n    rows = [[1]]\n    for r in range(1, n):\n        row = []\n        # Update the range to go from 0 to r+1 to ensure all elements are calculated\n        for c in range(0, r + 1):\n            upleft = rows[r - 1][c - 1] if c > 0 else 0\n            upright = rows[r - 1][c] if c < r else 0\n            row.append(upleft + upright)\n        rows.append(row)\n\n    return rows\n```\n\nThis change ensures that the inner loop iterates correctly, allowing it to produce the full row for each level of Pascal's triangle. Specifically, the loop now starts at 0 and goes up to `r + 1` (exclusive) allowing it to correctly compute the value of each element in the row. This will correct the bug and allow the function to generate Pascal's triangle accurately."

Therefore, the `for` loop should iterate from `0` to `r + 1` to include all necessary elements. \n\nHere's the corrected code:\n```python\ndef pascal(n):\n    rows = [[1]]\n    for r in range(1, n):\n        row = []\n        for c in range(r + 1):  # Fix: changed the range to r + 1\n            upleft = rows[r - 1][c - 1] if c > 0 else 0\n            upright = rows[r - 1][c] if c < r else 0\n            row.append(upleft + upright)\n        rows.append(row)\n\n    return rows\n```\n\nWith this change, `range(r + 1)` ensures that `c` runs appropriately from `0` through `r` (inclusive), thus creating the correct number of entries in each row."
