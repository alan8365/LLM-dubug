            "raw_code": "The bug in the code occurs because the function does not handle cases where `n` itself is a prime number or when the recursive call reaches a prime number. In the provided implementation, if `n` does not have any divisors within the loop range, the function returns an empty list, `[]`. This means that for a prime number, the prime itself will not be included in the output.\n\nTo fix this, the function should return a list containing `n` at the point where no divisors are found and the loop completes. This ensures that prime numbers are correctly included in the factor list. Here is the corrected function:\n\n```python\ndef get_factors(n):\n    if n == 1:\n        return []\n\n    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            return [i] + get_factors(n // i)\n\n    return [n]  # Corrected to return [n] instead of []\n```\n\nThis fix works by ensuring that when the loop terminates without finding any factors (which happens when `n` is a prime number), the function returns `[n]`. Hence, the prime factor is included in the list of factors correctly. This correction accurately handles all numbers, including those that are prime, ensuring that all are decomposed into their prime factors effectively."

For a prime number, the function should return the number itself as its only factor.\n\nCorrectly, if no factors are found in the range from 2 to the square root of `n`, the number `n` should itself be returned in a list, as this indicates that `n` is prime.\n\nThe corrected code will include `n` in the return statement at the end, as follows:\n\n```python\ndef get_factors(n):\n    if n == 1:\n        return []\n\n    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            return [i] + get_factors(n // i)\n\n    return [n]  # Corrected to return [n] when no factors are found\n```\n\nThis correction ensures that for a prime number or when no factors are found within the loop range, the number itself is considered as a prime factor.
