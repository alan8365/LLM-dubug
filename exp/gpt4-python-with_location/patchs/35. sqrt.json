The stopping condition is set to compare `x` directly with `approx`, which is conceptually incorrect as `approx` is supposed to approach the square root of `x`, not `x` itself.\n\nThe correct condition should compare the square of the approximation (`approx**2`) with `x`, to see if it's close enough to the value of which we want the square root. Here's the corrected version of the code:\n\n```python\ndef sqrt(x, epsilon):\n    approx = x / 2\n    while abs(approx**2 - x) > epsilon:  # Corrected this line\n        approx = 0.5 * (approx + x / approx)\n    return approx\n```\n\nThis change ensures that the loop continues to refine the approximation until the square of `approx` is within `epsilon` of `x`, which is what you typically want when calculating square roots."

The conditional expression `abs(x - approx)` incorrectly checks the absolute difference between `x` (the number whose square root is being computed) and `approx` (the current approximation of the square root).
