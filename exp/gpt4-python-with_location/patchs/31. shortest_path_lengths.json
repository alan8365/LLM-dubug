In the Floyd-Warshall algorithm, the indirect path length between nodes `i` and `j` through an intermediary node `k` should be calculated as:\n\n```python\nlength_by_path[i, j] = min(\n    length_by_path[i, j],\n    length_by_path[i, k] + length_by_path[k, j]  # Correct indices for intermediary computation\n)\n```\n\nInstead of adding `length_by_path[j, k]` (which represents the distance from node `j` to node `k`) to `length_by_path[i, k]` (distance from `i` to `k`), you should add `length_by_path[k, j]` (distance from `k` to `j`). This ensures that you're computing the distance from node `i` to node `j` passing through node `k`.\n\nHere's the corrected code:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef shortest_path_lengths(n, length_by_edge):\n    length_by_path = defaultdict(lambda: float('inf'))\n    length_by_path.update({(i, i): 0 for i in range(n)})  # Setting distance from node to itself as zero\n    length_by_path.update(length_by_edge)  # Setting given initial distances\n\n    for k in range(n):\n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(n):\n                length_by_path[i, j] = min(\n                    length_by_path[i, j],\n                    length_by_path[i, k] + length_by_path[k, j]  # Corrected indices for path calculation\n                )\n\n    return length_by_path\n```\n\nThis modification correctly implements the update step of the Floyd-Warshall algorithm, efficiently calculating the shortest paths between all pairs of nodes in a weighted graph."

This should actually be `length_by_path[i, k] + length_by_path[k, j]` to calculate the shortest path from node `i` to node `j` through an intermediate node `k`.\n\nHere is the corrected version of the `shortest_path_lengths` function:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef shortest_path_lengths(n, length_by_edge):\n    length_by_path = defaultdict(lambda: float('inf'))\n    length_by_path.update({(i, i): 0 for i in range(n)})\n    length_by_path.update(length_by_edge)\n\n    for k in range(n):\n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(n):\n                length_by_path[i, j] = min(\n                    length_by_path[i, j],\n                    length_by_path[i, k] + length_by_path[k, j]  # Corrected the bug here\n                )\n\n    return length_by_path\n```\n\nThis change ensures that the algorithm correctly considers the path's length from node `i` to node `j` through the intermediate node `k` by summing up the lengths of the paths from `i` to `k` and from `k` to `j`.
