In the line marked with `# The bug is here`, the move should actually be from the `start` peg to the `end` peg, not from the `start` peg to the `helper` peg as currently coded. This is essential for the Towers of Hanoi problem, as each recursive step intends to move the bottom disk of the current sub-problem to the destination peg (`end`), not to the helper peg.\n\nHere is the corrected version of the function:\n```python\ndef hanoi(height, start=1, end=3):\n    steps = []\n    if height > 0:\n        helper = ({1, 2, 3} - {start} - {end}).pop()\n        steps.extend(hanoi(height - 1, start, helper))\n        steps.append((start, end))  # Correct the movement to be from start to end\n        steps.extend(hanoi(height - 1, helper, end))\n\n    return steps\n```\n\nNow, the tuple `(start, end)` correctly represents moving the largest disk of the current sub-stack from the `start` peg to the `end` peg, which is a critical move in the Towers of Hanoi solution. Each recursive call properly organizes the smaller stacks around this main move."

This is the primary move for the topmost disk when solving the Tower of Hanoi problem.\n\nHere's the corrected line:\n```python\nsteps.append((start, end))\n```\n\nThe corrected function now looks like this:\n```python\ndef hanoi(height, start=1, end=3):\n    steps = []\n    if height > 0:\n        helper = ({1, 2, 3} - {start} - {end}).pop()\n        steps.extend(hanoi(height - 1, start, helper))\n        steps.append((start, end))  # Corrected bug: move disc directly from start to end\n        steps.extend(hanoi(height - 1, helper, end))\n    return steps\n```\n\nThis corrected version will properly record each move of the disk from the `start` peg to the `end` peg directly as required by the Tower of Hanoi puzzle approach, where you move the largest disk directly from start to end to ensure all smaller disks are on the helper peg temporarily."
