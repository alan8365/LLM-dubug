            "raw_code": "The bug in the code you provided is on the line where you are filtering the elements greater than the pivot to create the `greater` list. The issue is that it doesn't correctly handle numbers that are equal to the pivot; numbers equal to the pivot can be placed anywhere, but they are generally placed together with the pivot itself to avoid affecting the stability of the sort. In this specific implementation, such numbers are omitted entirely, which results in loss of data.\n\nTo correct the bug, you need to modify the list comprehension used to create the `greater` list so that it includes numbers that are greater than or equal to the pivot. Here is the corrected code:\n\n```python\ndef quicksort(arr):\n    if not arr:\n        return []\n\n    pivot = arr[0]\n    lesser = quicksort([x for x in arr[1:] if x < pivot])\n    greater = quicksort([x for x in arr[1:] if x >= pivot])  # Fixed bug: include values equal to pivot\n    return lesser + [pivot] + greater\n```\n\nHowever, this corrected version would still be inaccurate since it improperly includes the pivot itself in the `greater` array, leading to repeated counting of the pivot. To fix this, we must handle the pivot insertion separately:\n\n```python\ndef quicksort(arr):\n    if not arr:\n        return []\n\n    pivot = arr[0]\n    lesser = quicksort([x for x in arr[1:] if x < pivot])\n    greater = quicksort([x for x in arr[1:] if x > pivot])\n    pivots = [x for x in arr if x == pivot]  # Accurately handle multiple elements equal to pivot\n    return lesser + pivots + greater\n```\n\nWith this change, the function now accurately sorts elements, including handling multiple elements equal to the pivot correctly. This is a simple version of the quicksort and can be optimized in several ways, especially in the handling of the pivot selection and partitioning process."

            "raw_code": "The issue in your code is related to the handling of elements that are equal to the pivot. In your current implementation, elements that are equal to the pivot are not included in any recursive calls, resulting in an incomplete sorted list. This occurs because your list comprehensions in the recursive calls only handle elements less than or greater than the pivot.\n\nTo fix this issue, you should also handle the case where elements are equal to the pivot correctly. All elements equal to the pivot should be included in the final sorted list. Here's how you could modify the function:\n\n```python\ndef quicksort(arr):\n    if not arr:\n        return []\n\n    pivot = arr[0]\n    lesser = quicksort([x for x in arr[1:] if x < pivot])\n    equal = [x for x in arr if x == pivot]  # Add this line to handle elements equal to pivot\n    greater = quicksort([x for x in arr[1:] if x > pivot])\n\n    return lesser + equal + greater  # Include equal elements in the return\n```\n\nNow, the function properly handles all elements that are equal to the pivot by including them in the `equal` list and then appending this list between `lesser` and `greater`. This ensures that all elements are considered and the array is fully sorted."

In the case where there are duplicated values in the array that are equal to the pivot, these duplicates are lost after the partitioning step because such elements are not included in either the `lesser` or `greater` sublists.\n\nTo fix this, you must ensure that the elements equal to the pivot are also included in the resulting sorted array. We can do this by creating another list that includes elements equal to the pivot or by adjusting the list comprehension for the `greater` sublist to include these equal values.\n\nHere is the corrected code:\n\n```python\ndef quicksort(arr):\n    if not arr:\n        return []\n\n    pivot = arr[0]\n    lesser = quicksort([x for x in arr[1:] if x < pivot])\n    equal = [x for x in arr if x == pivot]  # Elements that are equal to the pivot.\n    greater = quicksort([x for x in arr[1:] if x > pivot])\n\n    return lesser + equal + greater\n```\n\nWith this adjustment, the `equal` list handles all instances of the pivot value, ensuring that duplicates are correctly sorted and included in the final result."
