In Reverse Polish Notation (RPN), the last popped item should be treated as the second operand (right operand), and the item popped before that should be the first operand (left operand).

Here is the corrected section of the code:\n\n```python\nelse:\n    b = stack.pop()  # First pop gets the second operand\n    a = stack.pop()  # Second pop gets the first operand\n    stack.append(\n        op(token, a, b)  # Corrected order of operands\n    )\n```\n\nHere is the corrected full function:\n\n```python\ndef rpn_eval(tokens):\n    def op(symbol, a, b):\n        return {\n            '+': lambda a, b: a + b,\n            '-': lambda a, b: a - b,\n            '*': lambda a, b: a * b,\n            '/': lambda a, b: a / b\n        }[symbol](a, b)\n\n    stack = []\n\n    for token in tokens:\n        if isinstance(token, float):\n            stack.append(token)\n        else:\n            b = stack.pop()\n            a = stack.pop()\n            stack.append(\n                op(token, a, b)\n            )\n\n    return stack.pop()\n```\n\nThis change ensures that the operands are used in their correct order according to RPN rules, fixing the logical error in your code."

In Reverse Polish Notation (RPN), the operations are applied such that the first element popped (which is `a` in this case) is actually the second operand, and the second element popped (`b`) is the first operand. Therefore, the operation should use operands in the order `b, a` instead of `a, b`.\n\nHere's the corrected code with adequate modification on the buggy line:\n\n```python\ndef rpn_eval(tokens):\n    def op(symbol, a, b):\n        return {\n            '+': lambda a, b: a + b,\n            '-': lambda a, b: a - b,\n            '*': lambda a, b: a * b,\n            '/': lambda a, b: a / b\n        }[symbol](a, b)\n\n    stack = []\n\n    for token in tokens:\n        if isinstance(token, float):\n            stack.append(token)\n        else:\n            a = stack.pop()\n            b = stack.pop()\n            stack.append(\n                op(token, b, a)  # Corrected the order of operands here\n            )\n\n    return stack.pop()\n```\n\nNow in the `op` function call, `b` is provided as the first operand and `a` as the second, aligning with the expected use order in RPN evaluation."
