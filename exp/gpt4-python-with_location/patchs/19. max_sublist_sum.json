The issue is that `max_ending_here` should reset to zero if it drops below zero, which is a core part of Kadane's Algorithm for finding the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray. In the current implementation, if all values are negative or a negative value causes the sum to drop below zero, the function will not correctly reset to potentially start a new subarray sum calculation. \n\nHere's the corrected code:\n\n```python\ndef max_sublist_sum(arr):\n    max_ending_here = 0\n    max_so_far = 0\n\n    for x in arr:\n        max_ending_here = max_ending_here + x\n        if max_ending_here < 0:  # Reset if the current sum drops below zero\n            max_ending_here = 0\n        max_so_far = max(max_so_far, max_ending_here)\n\n    return max_so_far\n```\n\nThis code will correctly handle cases where the sum of the subarray becomes negative. By resetting `max_ending_here` to zero whenever it becomes negative, it ensures that the subsequent calculations for subarray sums start anew from the next element, rather than dragging down the sum with negative values."

However, the code as written does not handle negative numbers correctly and fails to maintain the required properties of the Kadane's algorithm, which is the typical algorithm to solve this problem. Specifically, the algorithm needs to reset `max_ending_here` to zero whenever it becomes negative.\n\nLet's fix the bug on the specified line and amend the code to handle the complete algorithm:\n\n```python\ndef max_sublist_sum(arr):\n    max_ending_here = 0\n    max_so_far = -float('inf')  # Initialize to negative infinity to handle arrays with all negative numbers\n\n    for x in arr:\n        max_ending_here = max_ending_here + x\n        if max_ending_here < 0:  # Reset max_ending_here if it drops below 0\n            max_ending_here = 0\n        max_so_far = max(max_so_far, max_ending_here)\n\n    return max_so_far\n```\n\nWith the above correction, the function will now correctly reset `max_ending_here` to zero when it becomes negative, which ensures that no subarray with a negative sum is taken into account when a better start point (from zero) is possible.\n\nFurthermore, by updating `max_so_far` to start at negative infinity rather than zero, the function correctly handles arrays that are entirely negative or cases where the maximum subarray sum is actually zero. This ensures accurate results even in scenarios where all elements are negative or the best option results in not choosing any elements at all."

This can cause an issue where the function continues to add to a negative `max_ending_here`, which would not correctly represent subarray sums starting with the current element `x`.\n\nThe corrected code should update `max_ending_here` using the `max` function to ensure that it doesn't carry over a negative sum, which would be non-optimal for the purpose of finding the maximum subarray sum. Here's the corrected version of the code:\n\n```python\ndef max_sublist_sum(arr):\n    max_ending_here = 0\n    max_so_far = 0\n\n    for x in arr:\n        max_ending_here = max(0, max_ending_here + x)  # Fix: reset when sum becomes negative\n        max_so_far = max(max_so_far, max_ending_here)\n\n    return max_so_far\n\n# Example usage:\narr = [-2, 1, -3, 4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4]\nprint(max_sublist_sum(arr))  # Should print 6, from subarray [4, -1, 2, 1]\n```\n\nIn this fix:\n- The expression `max(0, max_ending_here + x)` ensures that `max_ending_here` is reset to `0` if the sum `max_ending_here + x` becomes negative. This way, any subarray that would decrease the total sum to below zero is discarded in favor of potentially more profitable subarrays starting afresh from a later position.\n- This change correctly implements the Kadane's algorithm for finding the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray within a one-dimensional numeric array."
