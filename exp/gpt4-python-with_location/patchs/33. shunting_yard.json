            "raw_code": "In the `shunting_yard` function provided above, the bug is related to managing the operator stack when a new operator token is encountered. The provided code doesn't actually push operators onto the stack; hence, there's no way operators could be added and subsequently processed (popped) from the stack.\n\nTo fix the code, we need to add the incoming operators to the `opstack` within the main `for` loop. Specifically, this should occur after you have evaluated and possibly popped operators from the stack based on their precedence but before moving to the next token in the input.\n\nLet's revise the code by inserting the necessary statement to push the operator onto the stack:\n\n```python\ndef shunting_yard(tokens):\n    precedence = {\n        '+': 1,\n        '-': 1,\n        '*': 2,\n        '/': 2\n    }\n\n    rpntokens = []\n    opstack = []\n    for token in tokens:\n        if isinstance(token, int):\n            rpntokens.append(token)\n        else:\n            while opstack and precedence[opstack[-1]] >= precedence[token]:  # Ensure top of stack has strictly higher precedence\n                rpntokens.append(opstack.pop())\n            opstack.append(token)  # Push the current operator onto the stack\n\n    while opstack:\n        rpntokens.append(opstack.pop())\n\n    return rpntokens\n\n# Example usage\nexample_tokens = [3, '+', 4, '*', 2]\nprint(shunting_yard(example_tokens))  # Expected output for RPN: [3, 4, 2, '*', '+']\n```\n\nNotice that a change was also made in the comparison within the while loop. Instead of checking `precedence[token] <= precedence[opstack[-1]]`, I have used `precedence[opstack[-1]] >= precedence[token]`. This is more intuitive as it directly checks if the operation on the top of the stack has higher or equal precedence compared to the current token, which should be popped first if true.\n\nThis corrected version of the function properly handles the operators by pushing them onto the stack and ensures that the operator with the highest precedence is popped first as per the Shunting Yard algorithm principles. This adjusted code should now correctly convert an infix expression (given as tokens) into a Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) or postfix notation."

            "raw_code": "The bug in the provided code lies in handling the operators and operator stack correctly. The code misses the part where it should push the current operator token onto the operator stack (`opstack`).\n\nAfter comparing the precedence of the current token with the token on the top of the operator stack, the current token itself should be pushed onto the stack. This step is missing in the provided code snippet. Here's the corrected version of the function:\n\n```python\ndef shunting_yard(tokens):\n    precedence = {\n        '+': 1,\n        '-': 1,\n        '*': 2,\n        '/': 2\n    }\n\n    rpntokens = []\n    opstack = []\n    for token in tokens:\n        if isinstance(token, int):\n            rpntokens.append(token)\n        else:\n            while opstack and precedence[token] <= precedence[opstack[-1]]:\n                rpntokens.append(opstack.pop())\n            opstack.append(token)  # Add this line to push the current operator onto the stack\n    while opstack:\n        rpntokens.append(opstack.pop())\n\n    return rpntokens\n```\n\nNow, in the loop where tokens are being read:\n- If the token is an operand (integer in this case), it's directly appended to `rpntokens`.\n- If the token is an operator, the while loop checks for the operators already on the stack and pops those with higher or equal precedence before the current operator is pushed onto the stack.\n\nThis correction ensures that all operators are correctly processed in adherence to their precedence and the shunting yard algorithm's expected behavior in generating Reverse Polish Notation (RPN)."

In the original code, when an operator token is found, it does not push the operator onto the `opstack`.

This change will ensure the algorithm implements the Shunting Yard correctly and produces a valid reverse Polish notation."
