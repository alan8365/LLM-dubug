The algorithm works by repeatedly replacing the larger number by its remainder when divided by the smaller number until one of the numbers becomes zero. The non-zero number at that point is the greatest common divisor (GCD).\n\nIn the given code, the recursive call to `gcd` has a bug. It uses the expression `gcd(a % b, b)`, but this is incorrect as it does not reduce the pair of numbers properly in each recursive step. For the Euclidean algorithm to work correctly, the arguments of the recursive call should be `b` and `a % b`:\n\n1. `a % b` gets the remainder when `a` is divided by `b`, which is smaller than `b`.\n2. The next step should use this remainder and the previous divisor (`b`) to continue the algorithm.\n\nHere is the corrected version of the code:\n\n```python\ndef gcd(a, b):\n    if b == 0:\n        return a\n    else:\n        return gcd(b, a % b)  # Corrected the order of parameters\n```\n\nNow, the function properly swaps the roles of the divisor and the remainder in each recursive call, accurately following the Euclidean algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor."
