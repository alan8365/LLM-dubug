            "raw_code": "The bug in the given code lies in the handling of the case where the first characters of the source and target strings are the same. Specifically, the `levenshtein` function implementation you provided incorrectly increments the edit distance by `1` when the characters match, which is counter to the definition of the Levenshtein distance. When the first characters of both strings match, it means no editing operation is needed for those characters, so the distance should remain the same for the rest of the strings instead of increasing.\n\nHere's the corrected version of the function:\n\n```python\ndef levenshtein(source, target):\n    if source == '' or target == '':\n        return len(source) or len(target)\n\n    elif source[0] == target[0]:\n        return levenshtein(source[1:], target[1:])  # Corrected here; remove the `1 +`\n\n    else:\n        return 1 + min(\n            levenshtein(source, target[1:]),\n            levenshtein(source[1:], target[1:]),\n            levenshtein(source[1:], target)\n        )\n```\n\nIn this corrected version, when the first characters are the same (`source[0] == target[0]`), the function directly recurses into `levenshtein(source[1:], target[1:])` without adding the `1`, preserving the edit distance for this matching of characters. Hence, the distance only increases when there is an actual edit operation (insertion, deletion, or substitution) required."

In the Levenshtein distance algorithm, if the characters at the current position in both strings are the same, no operation is needed (i.e., the cost is 0 for that step), and the function should recursively compute the distance for the remaining substrings starting from the next character.\n\nHowever, the original code incorrectly adds 1 to the result of the recursive call when the characters match, indicating an unnecessary operation. To fix this, you should simply return the result of the recursive call without adding 1.\n\nHere's the corrected version of the function:\n```python\ndef levenshtein(source, target):\n    if source == '' or target == '':\n        return len(source) or len(target)\n\n    elif source[0] == target[0]:\n        return levenshtein(source[1:], target[1:])    # Fixed bug: no addition needed\n\n    else:\n        return 1 + min(\n            levenshtein(source,     target[1:]),\n            levenshtein(source[1:], target[1:]),\n            levenshtein(source[1:], target)\n        )\n```\n\nThis corrected version accurately computes the Levenshtein distance by ensuring that the cost is only incremented for operations that modify the strings (insertions, deletions, or substitutions), and it correctly handles the case of matching characters by directly continuing with the remaining substrings."
