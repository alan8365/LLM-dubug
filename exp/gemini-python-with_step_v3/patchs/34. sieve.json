However, for a correct sieve algorithm, we want to check if `n` is divisible by any of the known primes, not if it is not divisible.\n\n**Step 2**: To fix the bug, change the condition inside `any` to check if the remainder of `n` divided by any prime in `primes` is equal to 0, indicating divisibility. Here's the corrected condition:\n```python\nif any(n % p == 0 for p in primes):\n```\n\n**Step 3**: Ensure that the corrected condition is used within the `for` loop to check if `n` is not divisible by any known primes.\n\n**Complete Fixed Code**:\n```python\ndef sieve(max):\n    primes = []\n    for n in range(2, max + 1):\n        if not any(n % p == 0 for p in primes):\n            primes.append(n)\n    return primes\n```"
