            "raw_code": "**Step 1:** The code above has an issue that a node might be visited multiple times during the search, which may cause an infinite loop. This happens since the `nodesvisited` set is not modified when a node is visited and is only checked if a node is in it but not added to it. This issue can be solved by adding the node to the `nodesvisited` set before checking for a match.\n\n**Step 2:** Another issue in the code above is that the final result of the `search_from` function is not returned in the `depth_first_search` function. This can be solved by returning the result of the `search_from` function in the `depth_first_search` function.\n\nThe fixed code:\n```python=\ndef depth_first_search(startnode, goalnode):\n    nodesvisited = set()\n\n    def search_from(node):\n        if node in nodesvisited:\n            return False\n        else:\n            nodesvisited.add(node)\n            if node is goalnode:\n                return True\n            else:\n                return any(\n                    search_from(nextnode) for nextnode in node.successors\n                )\n\n    return search_from(startnode)\n```"

            "raw_code": "**Step 1: Identify the bug**\n   The bug in the code is that the `nodesvisited` set is not being updated correctly. The code checks if a node is in the set before searching it, but it does not add the node to the set after searching it. This means that the code will keep searching the same nodes over and over again.\n\n**Step 2: Fix the bug**\n   To fix the bug, we need to add the node to the `nodesvisited` set after we search it. We can do this by adding the following line to the `search_from` function:\n```python=\nnodesvisited.add(node)\n```\n\n**Step 3: Test the code**\n   We can now test the code with a simple example. Here is a code example that creates a graph and then performs a depth-first search on it:\n```python=\nnode1 = Node(\"A\")\nnode2 = Node(\"B\")\nnode3 = Node(\"C\")\nnode4 = Node(\"D\")\nnode5 = Node(\"E\")\n\nnode1.successors = [node2, node3]\nnode2.successors = [node4]\nnode3.successors = [node5]\nnode4.successors = []\nnode5.successors = []\n\n\ndef depth_first_search(startnode, goalnode):\n    nodesvisited = set()\n\n    def search_from(node):\n        if node in nodesvisited:\n            return False\n        elif node is goalnode:\n            return True\n        else:\n            nodesvisited.add(node)\n            return any(\n                search_from(nextnode) for nextnode in node.successors\n            )\n\n    return search_from(startnode)\n\n\nprint(depth_first_search(node1, node5))\n```\n   This code will output `True`, indicating that the depth-first search was successful in finding the goal node."
