However, there is a bug in the code that prevents it from finding the correct shortest paths. The bug is in the line:\n\n```python\nweight_by_edge[u, v] = min(\n    weight_by_node[u] + weight,\n    weight_by_node[v]\n)\n```\n\nThis line is trying to update the weight of the edge between nodes u and v to be the minimum of the current weight and the weight of the path from the source node to node u plus the weight of the edge between nodes v and w. However, this line is incorrect because it is not taking into account the weight of the path from the source node to node v.\n\n**Step 2: Fix the bug**\n\nTo fix the bug, we need to update the line to be:\n\n```python\nweight_by_edge[u, v] = min(\n    weight_by_node[u] + weight,\n    weight_by_node[v] + weight\n)\n```\n\nThis line will now correctly update the weight of the edge between nodes u and v to be the minimum of the current weight and the weight of the path from the source node to node u or v.\n\n**Complete fixed code**\n\n```python\ndef shortest_paths(source, weight_by_edge):\n    weight_by_node = {\n        v: float('inf') for u, v in weight_by_edge\n    }\n    weight_by_node[source] = 0\n\n    for i in range(len(weight_by_node) - 1):\n        for (u, v), weight in weight_by_edge.items():\n            weight_by_edge[u, v] = min(\n                weight_by_node[u] + weight,\n                weight_by_node[v] + weight\n            )\n\n    return weight_by_node\n```"
