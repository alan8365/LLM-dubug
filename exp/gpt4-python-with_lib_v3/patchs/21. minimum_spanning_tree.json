However, it contains a bug related to the handling of the disjoint set (union-find) data structure. The bug lies in the implementation of merging sets of vertices when an edge is included in the MST. The code incorrectly shares sets among all linked nodes, causing issues in correctly finding the leader or representative of each set.\n\nHere's the corrected version of the function with detailed explanations:\n\n```python\ndef minimum_spanning_tree(weight_by_edge):\n    # This dictionary maps each node to its representative (leader)\n    leader = {}\n    \n    # This function finds the representative of a node, with path compression.\n    def find(node):\n        if leader[node] != node:\n            leader[node] = find(leader[node])  # Path compression\n        return leader[node]\n    \n    # This function unites two sets, linking one representative to another.\n    def union(node1, node2):\n        root1 = find(node1)\n        root2 = find(node2)\n        if root1 != root2:\n            leader[root2] = root1  # Union operation: attach one tree under another\n    \n    # Initialize each node to be its own leader.\n    for edge in weight_by_edge:\n        u, v = edge\n        if u not in leader:\n            leader[u] = u\n        if v not in leader:\n            leader[v] = v\n    \n    mst_edges = set()\n    \n    # Sort edges by their weight.\n    for edge in sorted(weight_by_edge, key=weight_by_edge.get):\n        u, v = edge\n        if find(u) != find(v):\n            mst_edges.add(edge)\n            union(u, v)\n    \n    return mst_edges\n\n# Example usage\nweights = {('A', 'B'): 3, ('B', 'C'): 1, ('A', 'C'): 2}\nmst = minimum_spanning_tree(weights)\nprint(mst)\n```\n\n### Key Changes Made:\n1. **Union-Find Implementation:** A correct union-find structure with path compression (`find` function) and union operation (`union` function). Each node starts as its own leader. The `find` function recursively finds the top leader of a node and compresses the path, and the `union` function merges two sets by linking their leaders.\n\n2. **Initialization of Leaders:** Before sorting and processing edges, the `leader` dictionary is initialized for each node encountered in the edges. This ensures that each node is known and has a leader.\n\n3. **Edge Sorting and Processing:** Edges are still sorted by weight. For each edge, it checks if the nodes are in different sets by comparing their leaders. If they are different, the edge is added to the MST, and the sets are united.\n\nThis corrected implementation ensures that the MST is correctly formed according to Kruskal's algorithm, using an efficient union-find data structure to manage the disjoint sets of nodes."

            "raw_code": "The provided Python code aims to implement the Kruskal's algorithm to find the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of a graph. However, there are issues in the code related to how it manages the groups (or sets) of connected nodes. Specifically, the code attempts to maintain groups using a dictionary `group_by_node`, but it does not correctly manage the merging of sets when an edge is added to the MST, which can lead to incorrect behavior.\n\nTo fix this bug, we need to make sure that when we merge two node sets, all references in `group_by_node` for the nodes of the merged set correctly point to the new merged set. The simplest way to achieve this is by implementing a Union-Find data structure, also known as Disjoint Set Union (DSU), to manage the groups of connected components efficiently.\n\nHere's the corrected version of the code using a Union-Find structure with path compression and union by rank:\n\n```python\nclass UnionFind:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.parent = {}\n        self.rank = {}\n    \n    def find(self, node):\n        if self.parent[node] != node:\n            self.parent[node] = self.find(self.parent[node])\n        return self.parent[node]\n    \n    def union(self, node1, node2):\n        root1 = self.find(node1)\n        root2 = self.find(node2)\n\n        if root1 != root2:\n            if self.rank[root1] > self.rank[root2]:\n                self.parent[root2] = root1\n            elif self.rank[root1] < self.rank[root2]:\n                self.parent[root1] = root2\n            else:\n                self.parent[root2] = root1\n                self.rank[root1] += 1\n\n    def make_set(self, node):\n        self.parent[node] = node\n        self.rank[node] = 0\n\ndef minimum_spanning_tree(weight_by_edge):\n    uf = UnionFind()\n    mst_edges = set()\n\n    # Initialize the union-find structure\n    for edge in weight_by_edge:\n        uf.make_set(edge[0])\n        uf.make_set(edge[1])\n\n    for edge in sorted(weight_by_edge, key=weight_by_edge.get):\n        u, v = edge\n        if uf.find(u) != uf.find(v):\n            mst_edges.add(edge)\n            uf.union(u, v)\n\n    return mst_edges\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Union-Find Class**: This class manages the connected components. The `find` method implements path compression, which flattens the structure of the tree whenever it is traversed to get the root, leading to very efficient queries. The `union` method uses union by rank, which attaches the shorter tree under the root of the deeper tree, balancing the tree and optimizing performance.\n\n2. **Union-Find Initialization**: Before iterating through the edges, all nodes are initialized as their own separate sets.\n\n3. **Edge Addition to MST**: The edges are sorted by weight, and the algorithm checks if two nodes of an edge are in different sets (using the `find` method). If they are in different sets, the edge is added to the MST, and the sets are united using the `union` method.\n\nThis implementation should correctly compute the MST using Kruskal's algorithm and efficiently manage the disjoint sets of nodes."
