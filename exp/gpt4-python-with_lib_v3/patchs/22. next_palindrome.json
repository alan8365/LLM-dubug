            "raw_code": "The function `next_palindrome` is meant to take a list of digits representing an integer, and find the next palindrome larger than the input number. To achieve this, the function should make the second half of the list mirror the first half. When the middle digits hit 9, they need to be reset to 0 and the digit before them should be incremented, similar to carrying in addition. If an increment results in the entire number becoming a series of zeros (like when input is 999), a new palindrome should be returned with a 1 at each end and zeros in between.\n\nThere's a logic bug in your code that incorrectly interprets how to reset and increment digits, and it doesn't properly handle the mirroring. Let's correct these issues step-by-step:\n\n1. **Carry Management**: When the center digits are 9 and need incrementing, setting them to 0 and moving outward is correct, but we're not ensuring other digits are incremented correctly, especially for the carry condition for whole numbers like 999.\n   \n2. **Mirroring**: Always ensure the mirroring condition applies to both halves of the digit sequence.\n\n3. **Return Statement**: The return for the case of incrementing past 999, 9999, etc., should add zeros in between 1s correctly.\n\nHere's the corrected code:\n\n```python\ndef next_palindrome(digit_list):\n    n = len(digit_list)\n    low_mid = (n - 1) // 2\n    high_mid = (n + 1) // 2\n\n    # Mirror the first half onto the second\n    digit_list[high_mid:] = digit_list[:low_mid + 1][::-1]\n\n    # Check if already a palindrome or not\n    if digit_list > digit_list[::-1]:\n        return digit_list\n\n    # Increase palindrome by 1 from the middle\n    i = low_mid\n    while i >= 0 and digit_list[i] == 9:\n        digit_list[i] = 0\n        digit_list[n - i - 1] = 0\n        i -= 1\n\n    # If all digits are zero, it was a sequence of 9s\n    if i < 0:\n        return [1] + [0] * (n - 1) + [1]\n\n    # Increment the center digit(s) which aren't 9\n    digit_list[i] += 1\n    digit_list[n - i - 1] = digit_list[i]\n\n    return digit_list\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Mirroring Section**: First, we make sure the second half of the list exactly mirrors the first half. \n2. **Check if Greater**: We then compare the newly formed number to its reverse; if it's already greater, just return it.\n3. **Handle 9s**: We handle all 9s by iterating from the middle to the start. If they are all 9s, we handle the edge case by appending 1s at both ends.\n4. **Increment Center**: If we need to increase the middle digit(s), we do so directly.\n\nThis will ensure that for inputs like [9, 9, 9] or [2, 3, 4, 9, 9], the next palindrome is correctly calculated."

Let's correct these issues:\n\n1. Fully propagate carries when consecutive 9s are encountered.\n2.

Set all digits between this position and the center to 0 (since they were previously 9 and wrapped around).\n4. **Reflecting Changes**: To ensure the result is a palindrome, copy the left half over the right half.\n5. The function now correctly handles edge cases like converting 999 to 1001 and ensures symmetrical results."

This ensures the number is palindromic, but not necessarily larger than the original.\n2. **Handling Single Digit**: If the list has just one digit, we handle this case separately by incrementing the value or making it `101` if the digit is `9`.\n3. **Checking for Modification**: A flag (`left_part_modified`) is added to check if the initial mirroring resulted in any change. If no change occurred and all digits are nine, this is a special scenario since merely mirroring will not give the next palindrome (e.g., `999` to `1001`).\n4. **Incrementing Logic**: In cases where mirroring wasn't enough or the mirrored number isn't larger than the input, the middle digit(s) are incremented with proper carry handling. This might lead to extending the length of the list (as in the transition from `999` to `1001`).\n5. **Final return**: If the entire list was incremented and overflowed (only nines), we return a new palindrome with a higher order of magnitude.\n\nThis revised approach properly addresses scenarios of varying input sizes and structures, including edge cases."
