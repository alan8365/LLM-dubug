However, there's a bug in the line where it yields `flatten(x)` for non-list elements. Here, `flatten(x)` is called recursively even when `x` is not a list, which is incorrect. It should simply yield `x` directly.\n\nI'll correct this issue so that the function works as intended for flattening nested lists:\n\n```python\ndef flatten(arr):\n    for x in arr:\n        if isinstance(x, list):\n            for y in flatten(x):\n                yield y\n        else:\n            yield x\n```\n\nThis corrected version of `flatten` will:\n1. Check if the current item `x` is a list.\n   - If it is, it recursively flattens `x`.\n   - If not, it directly yields `x` since it does not need further flattening.\n\nThis should correctly handle and flatten nested lists of arbitrary depth. For example:\n```python\nflat_list = list(flatten([1, [2, 3], [4, [5, 6]], 7]))\nprint(flat_list)  # Output should be: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]\n```\nThis change ensures that elements which are not lists are yielded directly, rather than erroneously attempting to recurse into them as if they were lists."
