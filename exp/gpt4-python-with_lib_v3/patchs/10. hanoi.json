            "raw_code": "The bug in the given code lies in the line where the move is recorded from the `start` peg to the `helper` peg, instead of from the `start` peg directly to the `end` peg in the main move of the disk. Furthermore, the recursive call parameters should be adjusted for proper recursive stack unwinding.\n\nHere's the corrected code:\n\n```python\ndef hanoi(height, start=1, end=3):\n    steps = []\n    if height > 0:\n        helper = ({1, 2, 3} - {start} - {end}).pop()\n        steps.extend(hanoi(height - 1, start, helper))    # Move n-1 disks from start to helper\n        steps.append((start, end))                       # Move the nth disk directly from start to end\n        steps.extend(hanoi(height - 1, helper, end))     # Move n-1 disks from helper to end\n\n    return steps\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n- The Tower of Hanoi recursive algorithm involves three steps:\n  1. Move the top `height-1` disks from the `start` peg to the `helper` peg.\n  2. Move the remaining disk (the largest one, if height is the number of disks) from the `start` peg directly to the `end` peg.\n  3. Move the `height-1` disks that were placed on the `helper` peg over to the `end` peg.\n  \n- In the original code, `steps.append((start, helper))` was incorrect because it should only move the disk from the `start` peg to the `end` peg as the main disk move in each recursive call, thus it should be `steps.append((start, end))`.\n\nThe corrected line ensures the largest disk in the current recursive context moves directly from the start peg to the destination peg, which is a fundamental rule in solving the Tower of Hanoi puzzle. This makes it a correct and efficient solution."

            "raw_code": "The provided Tower of Hanoi function has a logical bug in its step append operation. The purpose of the puzzle is to move disks between pegs with the constraint that no larger disk sits on top of a smaller one. In your function, you have misdirected the disks by appending the wrong move `(start, helper)` when it should indeed be `(start, end)` \u2013 as this indicates the actual move of the disk from the `start` peg to the `end` peg.\n\nThe fixed Python code is as follows:\n\n```python\ndef hanoi(height, start=1, end=3):\n    steps = []\n    if height > 0:\n        helper = ({1, 2, 3} - {start} - {end}).pop()  # Get the other peg\n        steps.extend(hanoi(height - 1, start, helper))  # Move height-1 disks to helper\n        steps.append((start, end))  # Move the bottom disk to end\n        steps.extend(hanoi(height - 1, helper, end))  # Move the height-1 disks from helper to end\n\n    return steps\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Base case**: When `height == 0`, the function does not add any steps because no moves are needed for zero disks.\n\n2. **Recursive strategy**:\n   - **First recursive call**: Move the top `height-1` disks from the `start` peg to the `helper` peg. This uses the `end` peg as an intermediary.\n   - **Main action**: Move the bottom-most disk (the largest of the current stack) directly from the `start` peg to the `end` peg. This is a critical move, and it was corrected to `(start, end)` from the incorrect `(start, helper)`.\n   - **Second recursive call**: Finally, the `height-1` disks that were moved to the `helper` peg are now moved to the `end` peg, using the `start` peg as an intermediary this time.\n\nThis recursive decomposition ensures all disks move according to the rules of the Tower of Hanoi puzzle, maintaining the smallest moves on top and adhering to the minimal move count."

            "raw_code": "The given code snippet is an implementation of the recursive solution for the Towers of Hanoi problem, however, there's a typo in the appending of the move step. In the code provided, the movement from `start` to `end` is incorrectly recorded as a move from `start` to `helper`. This should be corrected to reflect the move from `start` to `end`. Here's the corrected code:\n\n```python\ndef hanoi(height, start=1, end=3):\n    steps = []\n    if height > 0:\n        helper = ({1, 2, 3} - {start} - {end}).pop()\n        steps.extend(hanoi(height - 1, start, helper))\n        steps.append((start, end))  # Corrected line: Move from start to end\n        steps.extend(hanoi(height - 1, helper, end))\n\n    return steps\n```\n\nThis correction ensures that each recursive call properly records the intended movement of a disk from the starting peg to the ending peg directly, reflecting the basic operation in the Towers of Hanoi problem. Each recursive call first moves disks from the start peg to the helper peg, then moves the largest of these disks directly from the start peg to the end peg, and finally moves the disks from the helper peg to the end peg."
