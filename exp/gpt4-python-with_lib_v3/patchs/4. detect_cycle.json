            "raw_code": "There is a minor mistake in the code that needs to be addressed to ensure it functions correctly. The problem arises due to the naming conflict between the instance variable `successor` and the method `successor()` in the `Node` class. However, since the method `successor()` doesn't seem to perform any additional functionality apart from returning the `successor` attribute, we can confidently use the attribute directly.\n\nHere is the fixed version of the `detect_cycle` function. I have also added a check to handle the case where `hare` tries to move two steps forward but stops if it would result in accessing a `None` object's `successor` (which would raise an AttributeError):\n\n```python\ndef detect_cycle(node):\n    if not node:\n        return False\n\n    hare = tortoise = node\n\n    while True:\n        if hare.successor is None:\n            return False\n        hare = hare.successor\n\n        if hare.successor is None:\n            return False\n        hare = hare.successor\n\n        tortoise = tortoise.successor\n\n        if hare is tortoise:\n            return True\n```\n\nThis version of the `detect_cycle` checks both `hare.successor` and `hare.successor.successor` before moving the `hare` forward two steps. This approach ensures that we do not attempt to access an attribute of a `None` object, which would lead to an error. The check at the start (`if not node:`) ensures that the function also correctly handles the case where the input node is `None`. The algorithm efficiently detects cycles using the tortoise and hare approach (Floyd\u2019s Cycle-Finding Algorithm), which is suitable for detecting loops in linked lists or similar structures where a cycle may exist."

            "raw_code": "There is an issue in the original code where the `hare` can encounter a situation where its `successor` is `None` and then it attempts to access the `successor` of `None`, leading to an error. Additionally, the method definitions in the `Node` class are using the same names as instance variables, which can cause confusion and malfunction. Since the library is uneditable, we'll focus on fixing the cycle detection function while ignoring potential conflicting names in `Node`.\n\nTo fix the cycle detection algorithm, we must ensure we handle any possibility where the `hare` or `tortoise` might try to access a `None` successor. Here's the corrected version of the `detect_cycle` function:\n\n```python\ndef detect_cycle(node):\n    if node is None:\n        return False\n\n    hare = tortoise = node\n\n    while hare and hare.successor:\n        tortoise = tortoise.successor\n        hare = hare.successor.successor\n\n        if hare is None:\n            return False\n\n        if hare is tortoise:\n            return True\n\n    return False\n```\n\n## Key Fixes:\n1. **Initial Null Check**: Added a check at the beginning to handle the case where the passed node is `None`.\n2. **Move Safely**: Updated the loop condition to check the existence of the `hare` and `hare.successor`. This prevents trying to access properties from a `None` object.\n3. **Check `hare` Is `None`**: Inside the loop, added a check right after updating `hare` to see if it has become `None` after moving two steps. If it is, return `False` as we've reached the end without finding a cycle. This check is essential due to the double step `hare` takes.\n4. **Return Immediately**: If the cycle condition (`hare is tortoise`) is met, return `True` immediately, indicating a cycle is present.\n\nThis implementation effectively prevents errors related to accessing properties of `None` and handles nodes that might be `None` themselves."

            "raw_code": "The original code has a couple of issues that need to be addressed:\n1. There is confusion created by the property methods being named the same as the corresponding attributes in the `Node` class. We need to make sure to use the property, not the attribute.\n2. We need to check if `hare.successor` and `hare.successor.successor` exist before assigning them to avoid `AttributeError`. \n\nHere is the fixed version of the `detect_cycle` function:\n\n```python\ndef detect_cycle(node):\n    hare = tortoise = node\n\n    while True:\n        if hare.successor is None or hare.successor.successor is None:\n            return False\n\n        tortoise = tortoise.successor\n        hare = hare.successor.successor\n\n        if hare == tortoise:\n            return True\n```\n\n### Changes Made:\n1. **Bug Fix: Preventing `NoneType` Error** - I added a condition to check if either `hare.successor` or `hare.successor.successor` is `None` before proceeding with the assignment. This prevents the code from trying to access a successor of `None`, which would raise an `AttributeError`.\n2. **Correct Equality Check** - The comparison `hare == tortoise` remains unchanged as it accurately checks if the hare and tortoise have met, indicating a cycle.\n\n### Note:\n- I assumed that each node correctly leads to its `successor`, and since the `successor` method in Node class is not called (which returns itself), I avoided modifying the Node class implementation.\n- The code does not cover complex graph structures with branches (`successors`). This code strictly follows the idea that each node leads to one and only one successor (`successor`), making it suitable primarily for linked list cycle detection."
