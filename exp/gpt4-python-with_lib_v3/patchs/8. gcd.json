There is a small bug in the recursive call within the else block. The parameters `a` and `b` should be swapped in the recursive call to correctly align with the Euclidean algorithm steps. The corrected code is as follows:\n\n```python\ndef gcd(a, b):\n    if b == 0:\n        return a\n    else:\n        return gcd(b, a % b)\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- In the Euclidean algorithm, to find the GCD of two numbers `a` and `b`, where `a` is greater than `b`, the process is to repeatedly replace `a` by `b` and `b` by `a % b` (the remainder of `a` divided by `b`) until `b` becomes 0. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.\n- The original code mistakenly made the recursive call with `gcd(a % b, b)`, which does not reduce the problem towards the base case for all possible inputs, and could result in incorrect answers or a recursion error for certain pairs of inputs.\n- With the fix `gcd(b, a % b)`, it ensures that the second parameter keeps reducing with each recursive step, eventually hitting the base case `b == 0`."

When calling the function recursively, the arguments need to be properly switched to ensure the proper Euclidean method functionality.\n\nTo fix the code, you need to switch `a % b` with `b` for the recursive call as follows:\n\n```python\ndef gcd(a, b):\n    if b == 0:\n        return a\n    else:\n        return gcd(b, a % b)\n```\n\nThis modification ensures that each successive call to the `gcd` function correctly reduces the problem size by applying the modulo operation, which is the essence of the Euclidean algorithm for finding GCD. By recursing with `b` and `a % b`, the function keeps reducing `b` until it becomes zero, at which point `a` will be the GCD."
