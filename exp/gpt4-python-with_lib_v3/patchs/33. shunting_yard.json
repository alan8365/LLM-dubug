            "raw_code": "The provided code snippet for the `shunting_yard` function is an implementation of the Shunting Yard algorithm by Edsger Dijkstra, which converts infix expressions to postfix (Reverse Polish Notation, RPN). The bug in the code primarily involves the handling of operators in the `opstack`. Operators are not being pushed onto the stack when encountered, which prevents the formation of a correct postfix expression. Here's the corrected code:\n\n```python\ndef shunting_yard(tokens):\n    precedence = {\n        '+': 1, \n        '-': 1, \n        '*': 2, \n        '/': 2\n    }\n\n    rpntokens = []  # This will store the output Reverse Polish Notation\n    opstack = []    # This will be our operator stack\n\n    for token in tokens:\n        if isinstance(token, int):     # Operand\n            rpntokens.append(token)\n        else:                          # Operator\n            # While there's an operator on the opstack with higher precedence\n            # or the operator at the top of the opstack has the same precedence\n            # and the operator is left associative, pop operators from the\n            # opstack, onto the output queue.\n            while (opstack and precedence[opstack[-1]] >= precedence[token]):\n                rpntokens.append(opstack.pop())\n            # Push the read operator onto the opstack.\n            opstack.append(token)\n\n    # Pop all the operators from the stack\n    while opstack:\n        rpntokens.append(opstack.pop())\n\n    return rpntokens\n```\n\n### Key Changes and Fixes:\n1. **Operator Handling**: When an operator is encountered, the code previously did not push this operator onto the `opstack`. The corrected version now includes `opstack.append(token)` to ensure all operators are properly pushed onto the stack.\n\n2. **Precedence Checking**: I adjusted the precedence check condition in the while loop from `precedence[token] <= precedence[opstack[-1]]` to `precedence[opstack[-1]] >= precedence[token]` for clarity and correctness.\n\nThis updated version of the function will properly handle and output the tokens for a postfix expression based on standard infix input, assuming operators and integers are the only token types. For a complete implementation, you may need to consider parentheses and other types of tokens depending on the complexity of the expressions to be parsed."

            "raw_code": "The provided code sample for the Shunting Yard algorithm misses a key aspect of handling operators correctly: adding operators to the stack. Also, the function should handle parentheses for full compliance with the algorithm. However, without explicit requirements for parentheses in your example, I will provide a solution for basic arithmetic operations without parentheses. Here's the fixed code:\n\n```python\ndef shunting_yard(tokens):\n    precedence = {\n        '+': 1,\n        '-': 1,\n        '*': 2,\n        '/': 2\n    }\n\n    rpntokens = []  # This will store the result in Reverse Polish Notation\n    opstack = []    # This is the operator stack\n    for token in tokens:\n        if isinstance(token, int):  # If the token is a number, add it to the result list\n            rpntokens.append(token)\n        else:\n            # If the token is an operator, pop operators from the operator stack to the output\n            # until the token on the operator stack has less precedence or the stack is empty\n            while opstack and precedence[token] <= precedence[opstack[-1]]:\n                rpntokens.append(opstack.pop())\n            # After clearing the precedence, push the current operator on the stack\n            opstack.append(token)\n    \n    # Pop all the operators left in the stack\n    while opstack:\n        rpntokens.append(opstack.pop())\n\n    return rpntokens\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Handling Numbers and Operators**: When it encounters a number, it simply appends it to the output list (`rpntokens`). When it finds an operator, firstly, it checks and pops from the operator stack to the output list until it finds an operator on the stack that has lower precedence than the current operator or the stack is empty.\n\n2. **Pushing the Operator**: After handling the precedence, the current operator is pushed onto the stack. This was missing in the provided code, where the operators were never pushed to the stack, causing it to function incorrectly.\n\n3. **Emptying the Stack**: Finally, after processing all tokens, it empties any remaining operators on the stack into the output list.\n\nThis fixed implementation correctly handles the basic arithmetic operations using the Shunting Yard algorithm without parentheses. If you need to handle parentheses or any other features, additional modifications will be required."
