            "raw_code": "The provided code attempts to wrap text into lines, each of a specified maximum length (`cols`). However, there are a few issues with the original code:\n1. The function doesn't handle the case where the remaining part of the text after the loop is shorter than `cols` but still needs to be added to the list of lines.\n2. In the case where a break occurs exactly at a space, the subsequent line will start with that space, which is typically undesirable in text processing.\n\nHere's an improved version of the function that addresses these issues:\n\n```python\ndef wrap(text, cols):\n    lines = []\n    while len(text) > cols:\n        end = text.rfind(' ', 0, cols)\n        if end == -1:\n            end = cols\n        else:\n            line = text[:end].strip()\n            text = text[end:].strip()\n        lines.append(line)\n    \n    if text:\n        lines.append(text.strip())\n    \n    return lines\n```\n\n### Explanation and Changes Made:\n1. **Finding the line break position:** The search for a space (`text.rfind(' ', 0, cols)`) now excludes the position at `cols+1`. This change ensures that we break at or before `cols` characters, adhering strictly to the maximum length requirement.\n2. **Handling spaces correctly:** I added `.strip()` to remove any leading or trailing spaces when forming the current line (`line`) and updating the remaining text (`text`). This prevents any line from starting with a space.\n3. **Appending the final part of the text:** After the loop, if any text remains (`if text:`), it's added to `lines`. This ensures that all text is accounted for, including the last piece which might be shorter than `cols`.\n4. **Overall logic:** The logic continues until all text is processed, ensuring each line is at most `cols` in length, and no initial space starts a new line.\n\nThis revised function works efficiently by ensuring each line adheres to the maximum length and improves readability by tidying up spaces appropriately."

The function prematurely truncates the text when it cannot find a space within the specified column width, causing potential line breaks within words.\n2. If there are no spaces within the `cols` limit, the function might stuck in an infinite loop because `text` is not properly sliced.\n3. The function doesn't handle the case where the entire remaining part of `text` is shorter than or equal to `cols`. This can lead to it never being added to the `lines` list.\n\nHere's the revised version of the function with the fixes:\n\n```python\ndef wrap(text, cols):\n    lines = []\n    while len(text) > cols:\n        # Find the last space within the first `cols` characters\n        end = text.rfind(' ', 0, cols + 1)\n        if end == -1:  # No space found in the range\n            end = cols\n            # Extend the search to the next space to avoid breaking a word\n            if cols < len(text):\n                next_space = text.find(' ', end)\n                if next_space != -1:\n                    end = next_space\n        # Slice the text to make a new line, and prepare remainder\n        line, text = text[:end].strip(), text[end:].strip()\n        lines.append(line)\n\n    # If there's any remaining text that is less than or equal to `cols`, add it as a line\n    if text:\n        lines.append(text)\n\n    return lines\n```\n\n### Changes Explained:\n1. The function now looks for a space after reaching the column limit to avoid breaking words whenever possible.\n2. The `.strip()` methods are used to remove any leading and trailing whitespace when slicing the `text` to form `line` and the new `text`. This keeps the result neat and ensures that there aren't any empty `line` entries due to remnants of spaces.\n3. The final check for any residual text ensures that if the loop exits with text remaining that is shorter than the column limit, it gets appended as is, handling the issue where the end of the text might not be added to the output list."

The function seeks to break lines at spaces where possible, to avoid breaking words. However, the function has a few issues that need to be addressed:\n\n1. The while loop may not terminate correctly if the remaining text is less than or equal to `cols` but still hasn't been added to the `lines`.\n2. When `end` is calculated using `text.rfind(' ', 0, cols + 1)`, if `end == -1` this means there is no space within the first `cols+1` characters, and thus it defaults to cutting at `cols`. This can lead to unclean breaks in a word.\n3. After setting `end`, the code splits the text for the current line and the remainder. But if `end` is set to `cols` because there were no spaces, the next part of the text (`text[end:]`) will start with a space, which might not be desirable.\n4. The final part of the text which is less than or equal to `cols` in length is not being added to the `lines` list.\n\nHere is the corrected version of the code:\n\n```python\ndef wrap(text, cols):\n    lines = []\n    while text:  # Change this to process all text until text is empty\n        if len(text) <= cols:\n            lines.append(text)\n            break  # If the remaining text fits in one line, add it and break out\n\n        # Find the last space within the valid line length; if none, force a break\n        end = text.rfind(' ', 0, cols + 1)\n        if end == -1:\n            end = cols\n        else:\n            # To ensure the loop progresses, avoid ending with a space\n            end += 1\n\n        line, text = text[:end].strip(), text[end:].strip()\n        lines.append(line)\n\n    return lines\n```\n\n### Explanation and Improvements\n1. Changed the loop to continue until `text` is empty.\n2. If the remaining `text` is shorter than or equal to `cols`, it appends the remaining text to `lines` and breaks out of the loop.\n3. Improved handling of `end` to increase it by 1 when a space is found within the limit, which helps to maintain words without breaking them unnecessarily.\n4. Added `strip()` for both `line` and `text` when splitting to remove leading and trailing spaces.\n\nThis revised approach ensures that:\n- Each line is filled as much as possible without breaking words unless absolutely necessary.\n- Extra spaces at the beginning or end of lines are removed.\n- All of the text is processed.\n"
