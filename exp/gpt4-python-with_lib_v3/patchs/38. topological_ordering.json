            "raw_code": "The provided Python code attempts to generate a topological ordering of nodes using a simple algorithm, but it contains several issues that break the intended functionality. Here is a breakdown of the issues and fixes provided in the updated implementation:\n\n1. **Shared Mutable Default Arguments:** The `Node` class constructor uses mutable default arguments (`successors`, `predecessors`, `incoming_nodes`, `outgoing_nodes`), which can lead to unexpected behavior as all instances of `Node` without explicitly passed lists will share the same list reference. This needs to be corrected by using `None` defaults and initializing new lists in the constructor.\n\n2. **Topological Sort Logic:** The original topological sort logic is flawed. It only iteratively appends nodes to `ordered_nodes` if all of their predecessors are already in `ordered_nodes`. However, this check is not correctly implemented, and the algorithm neglects to update and track the remaining incoming edges count properly.\n\nHere's the revised version of the code:\n\n```python\nclass Node:\n    def __init__(self, value=None, successors=None, predecessors=None, incoming_nodes=None, outgoing_nodes=None):\n        self.value = value\n        self.successors = successors if successors is not None else []\n        self.predecessors = predecessors if predecessors is not None else []\n        self.incoming_nodes = incoming_nodes if incoming_nodes is not None else []\n        self.outgoing_nodes = outgoing_nodes if outgoing_nodes is not None else []\n\ndef topological_ordering(nodes):\n    # Initialize the list to store the topologically sorted nodes\n    ordered_nodes = []\n    \n    # Find nodes with no incoming edges\n    no_incoming_nodes = [node for node in nodes if not node.incoming_nodes]\n    \n    while no_incoming_nodes:\n        # Take a node with no incoming edges\n        current_node = no_incoming_nodes.pop()\n        ordered_nodes.append(current_node)\n        \n        # Go through each of its outgoing nodes\n        for next_node in current_node.outgoing_nodes:\n            # Remove the current node from the incoming nodes of the next node\n            next_node.incoming_nodes.remove(current_node)\n            # If this was the last incoming edge, add to no_incoming_nodes\n            if not next_node.incoming_nodes:\n                no_incoming_nodes.append(next_node)\n    \n    # Check for cycles (nodes with remaining incoming edges)\n    if any(node.incoming_nodes for node in nodes):\n        raise ValueError(\"The graph has at least one cycle and cannot be topologically sorted.\")\n    \n    return ordered_nodes\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Initialization of Variables:** The mutable default arguments have been replaced with `None` defaults, and lists are initialized directly within the constructor.\n- **Topological Sort Implementation:** Used Kahn's Algorithm to handle the topological sorting:\n  - Collect all nodes with no incoming edges.\n  - Iteratively remove nodes from the set, append them to the result, and reduce the count of incoming edges of their successors.\n  - If any node still has incoming edges after processing all nodes, raise an error as it indicates a cycle.\n\nThis revised version of the code correctly handles the topological sorting of nodes and addresses the potential issues arising from shared mutable default arguments in the class definition."

However, there are multiple issues in the given code and the associated library that need to be addressed. Below is an improved version with corrections:\n\n### Issues in Original Code:\n\n1. **Mutable Default Arguments**: The `Node` class uses mutable default arguments for `successors`, `predecessors`, `incoming_nodes`, and `outgoing_nodes`. This can lead to unexpected behavior because defaults are shared between all instances. Each node instance should have its own list.\n\n2. **Incorrect Handling of Topological Sort**: The algorithm provided attempts to add nodes to `ordered_nodes` without correctly managing dependencies and checking for cycles or nodes that are not yet ready to be added.\n\n3. **Misuse of Python Properties and Methods**: The properties like `successors` are defined both as a method and an instance attribute, which can lead to confusion and errors.\n\n### Improved Code with Fixed Library and Function:\n\n```python\nclass Node:\n    def __init__(self, value=None):\n        self.value = value\n        self.incoming_nodes = []\n        self.outgoing_nodes = []\n\n# Topological sort using Kahn's Algorithm\ndef topological_ordering(nodes):\n    # Step 1: Create a list to store the sorted elements\n    ordered_nodes = []\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate in-degree (number of incoming edges) for each node\n    in_degree = {node: len(node.incoming_nodes) for node in nodes}\n\n    # Step 3: Collect all nodes with in-degree 0\n    queue = [node for node in nodes if in_degree[node] == 0]\n\n    while queue:\n        node = queue.pop(0)\n        ordered_nodes.append(node)\n\n        for successor in node.outgoing_nodes:\n            in_degree[successor] -= 1  # Decrement the in-degree\n            if in_degree[successor] == 0:\n                queue.append(successor)  # Enqueue if no more incoming edges\n\n    # Check for cycle (if the graph has edges, but we could not resolve all dependencies)\n    if len(ordered_nodes) != len(nodes):\n        raise ValueError(\"Graph has at least one cycle or inconsistent state\")\n\n    return ordered_nodes\n\n# Example usage:\nnodeA = Node('A')\nnodeB = Node('B')\nnodeC = Node('C')\nnodeD = Node('D')\nnodeE = Node('E')\n\nnodeA.outgoing_nodes.append(nodeB)\nnodeB.incoming_nodes.append(nodeA)\nnodeB.outgoing_nodes.append(nodeC)\nnodeC.incoming_nodes.append(nodeB)\nnodeA.outgoing_nodes.append(nodeD)\nnodeD.incoming_nodes.append(nodeA)\nnodeC.outgoing_nodes.append(nodeE)\nnodeE.incoming_nodes.append(nodeC)\n\nnodes = [nodeA, nodeB, nodeC, nodeD, nodeE]\n\ntry:\n    order = topological_ordering(nodes)\n    print([node.value for node in order])\nexcept ValueError as e:\n    print(e)\n```\n\n### Key Changes Made:\n\n- Fixed mutable default arguments by removing default lists in the constructor of `Node`.\n- Implemented Kahn\u2019s Algorithm for topological sorting, which uses a queue to manage nodes ready to be added to the sort order based on their in-degree.\n- Added robust cycle detection to handle cyclic graphs or inconsistent states where topological sorting is impossible.\n\nThis version should perform as expected for directed acyclic graphs and give a clear error for graphs that contain cycles."

Each new node using defaults will share the same list instances, leading to unexpected behavior.\n\n2. **Topological Sorting Logic**: The method for finding nodes with no incoming nodes and then sequentially adding nodes that depend on already sorted nodes is somewhat simplistic and flawed since it does not remove incoming edges and does not check nodes correctly.\n\n3. **Repeated Conversion**: The conversion `set(ordered_nodes)` in the loop unnecessarily repeats, potentially slowing the process.\n\nTo fix these issues, the following changes can be made:\n\n- Use default `None` for mutable fields in the `Node` class, initializing them in the constructor if they are `None`.\n- Rewrite the topological sorting algorithm, typically using Kahn's algorithm which involves using a queue or stack for maintaining nodes without incoming edges and iteratively removing edges.\n\nHere is the revised code:\n\n```python\nclass Node:\n    def __init__(self, value=None, successor=None, successors=None, predecessors=None, incoming_nodes=None, outgoing_nodes=None):\n        self.value = value\n        self.successor = successor if successor else []\n        self.successors = successors if successors else []\n        self.predecessors = predecessors if predecessors else []\n        self.incoming_nodes = incoming_nodes if incoming_nodes else []\n        self.outgoing_nodes = outgoing_nodes if outgoing_nodes else []\n\ndef topological_ordering(nodes):\n    # Create a copy of the incoming nodes list to manipulate\n    in_degree = {node: len(node.incoming_nodes) for node in nodes}\n    # Prepare a list to store the result (topological ordering)\n    ordered_nodes = []\n    # Use a queue to manage nodes with no incoming edges\n    queue = [node for node in nodes if len(node.incoming_nodes) == 0]\n    \n    while queue:\n        current_node = queue.pop(0)\n        ordered_nodes.append(current_node)\n        \n        for next_node in current_node.outgoing_nodes:\n            # Reduce the in_degree count of outgoing nodes\n            in_degree[next_node] -= 1\n            # If no more incoming edges, add to queue\n            if in_degree[next_node] == 0:\n                queue.append(next_node)\n    \n    if len(ordered_nodes) != len(nodes):\n        raise Exception(\"A cycle was detected in the graph, and thus, a topological ordering is not possible.\")\n    \n    return ordered_nodes\n```\n\nThis code utilizes a more robust approach using Kahn's algorithm for topological sorting which involves:\n- Using an `in_degree` dictionary to keep track of the number of incoming edges for each node.\n- Starting with nodes that have no incoming edges and reducing the incoming edge count for each outgoing node's destination.\n- If a node's incoming edge count drops to zero during this process, it\u2019s added to the queue for further processing.\n- Error handling to detect cycles in the graph if the sorted result does not contain all nodes."
