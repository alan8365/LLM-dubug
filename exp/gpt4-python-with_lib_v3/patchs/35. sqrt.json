            "raw_code": "The provided code snippet for calculating the square root using the Newton-Raphson method contains a logical error. The termination condition in the `while` loop is incorrect. Instead of checking the difference between the original number `x` and the approximation `approx`, you should check the difference between successive approximations to ensure convergence. Let's correct this:\n\n```python\ndef sqrt(x, epsilon):\n    if x < 0:\n        return None  # Return None or raise an Error as square root of negative number is not defined in real numbers\n    if x == 0:\n        return 0  # Directly return 0 if x is 0 to handle this edge case\n    approx = x / 2\n    while True:\n        next_approx = 0.5 * (approx + x / approx) # Calculate the next approximation\n        if abs(next_approx - approx) < epsilon:   # Check if the change between successive approximations is within the tolerance\n            break\n        approx = next_approx\n    return approx\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Handling Negative Inputs and Zero**: The function now checks for negative input `x` and returns `None` as the square root of a negative number is not defined in the realm of real numbers. When `x` is zero, it returns `0` immediately.\n   \n2. **Updated While Loop Condition**: The modified `while` loop utilizes a `True` condition to keep iterating \"forever\" until broken by the `if` statement inside. This statement checks if the change between successive approximations is less than the specified `epsilon` tolerance. This is crucial for ensuring that the function terminates when the approximation stabilizes to within the desired tolerance.\n\n3. **Variable Naming**: `next_approx` is used to compute the next approximation step and makes the transition between successive approximations clear.\n\nThis corrected code ensures that the approximation of the square root converges effectively based on the changes in approximations, rather than checking against the original number `x`, which was not a proper way to ensure convergence to the square root."

            "raw_code": "It appears that the core logic of your square root calculation is correct, but there's a bug in the loop condition. The purpose of the `while` loop in the function is to refine the `approx` value until it approximates the square root of `x` with enough accuracy, determined by `epsilon`.\n\nThe bug lies in the expression used to evaluate the loop's continuation condition. The correct condition should check how close `approx * approx` is to `x`, not `x - approx`. The loop should check that the square of `approx` (`approx * approx`), which estimates `x`, is within `epsilon` of the actual value `x`.\n\nHere's the fixed version of the function:\n```python\ndef sqrt(x, epsilon):\n    approx = x / 2.0\n    # Using approx^2 to approximate x and continue the loop until the error is within epsilon\n    while abs(approx**2 - x) > epsilon:\n        approx = 0.5 * (approx + x / approx)\n    return approx\n```\nThis revised loop condition uses `abs(approx**2 - x)` to ensure that the squared approximation is within an `epsilon` range of `x`, which accurately reflects the intended logic for computing the square root using the Newton-Raphson method."
