However, there are a couple of issues in the implementation that prevent it from working correctly:\n\n1. The condition in the `while` loop should have `lo < hi` instead of `lo <= hi`. This is because we're adjusting `lo` and `hi` such that our target always lies within `[lo, hi)`. Hence, `hi` should always be set to `mid`, not `mid + 1`.\n2. The assignment in the case of `x <= arr[mid]` should be `hi = mid`, not just `mid`. To correctly narrow down the search space to `[lo, mid)`.\n\nHere's the corrected version of the `find_first_in_sorted` function:\n\n```python\ndef find_first_in_sorted(arr, x):\n    lo = 0\n    hi = len(arr)\n\n    while lo < hi:  # Change this to lo < hi\n        mid = (lo + hi) // 2\n\n        if x == arr[mid] and (mid == 0 or x != arr[mid - 1]):\n            return mid\n        elif x <= arr[mid]:\n            hi = mid  # Correctly narrow the high range without skipping mid\n        else:\n            lo = mid + 1\n\n    return -1\n```\n\nIn this version:\n- The `while` loop runs as long as `lo` is less than `hi`, ensuring that `mid` is always recalculated based on the non-overlapping search space.\n- For the condition `x <= arr[mid]`, we set `hi` to `mid` to exclude the current `mid` from the next search space when `x` is less than or equal to `arr[mid]`, correctly narrowing the range to `[lo, mid)`.\n- The logic for `lo = mid + 1` remains intact, as it is used to narrow down the search space to `[mid + 1, hi)` when the middle value is less than `x`.\n\nWith these changes, the function should work correctly to find the first occurrence of `x` in a sorted array `arr`. If `x` is not in the array, it returns `-1`, indicating `x` is not found."

The condition in the `while` loop should not allow `lo` to equal `hi` when determining `mid` because you might end up with an infinite loop or an out of bounds error when `lo == hi` and then `mid` also equals `lo` or `hi`.\n2. In the decrease of the `hi` within the `elif` statement, you should use `mid - 1` instead of just `mid` to avoid an infinite loop when `x` is less than `arr[mid]`.\n\nHere is the corrected version of your code:\n\n```python\ndef find_first_in_sorted(arr, x):\n    lo = 0\n    hi = len(arr) - 1  # Change upper bound to len(arr) - 1\n\n    while lo <= hi:\n        mid = (lo + hi) // 2\n\n        if x == arr[mid] and (mid == 0 or x != arr[mid - 1]):\n            return mid\n\n        elif x <= arr[mid]:\n            hi = mid - 1  # Change `hi` assignment to `mid - 1`\n\n        else:\n            lo = mid + 1\n\n    return -1\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- Setting `hi` to `len(arr) - 1` ensures that the `hi` index always references a valid position within the array.\n- Adjusting `hi` to `mid - 1` during the `elif` case ensures that the search space is reduced correctly, preventing an infinite loop because `mid` will always be reduced in the next iteration if `x` is not found.\n- The condition in the `if` statement `x == arr[mid]` checks if the current element is the target `x`. The additional condition `(mid == 0 or x != arr[mid - 1])` ensures that the element is the first occurrence of `x` in the array by checking if it's either at the start of the array or different from the previous element."
