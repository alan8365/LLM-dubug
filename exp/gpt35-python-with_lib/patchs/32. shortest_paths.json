Changed the outer loop iterator variable from `i` to `_` since we don't need to use the loop index.\n2. Added an additional update of `weight_by_node[v]` to ensure the shortest path to `v` is updated correctly.\n3. Updated the calculation of the new weight for `weight_by_edge[u, v]` to consider the weight of the edge correctly."
