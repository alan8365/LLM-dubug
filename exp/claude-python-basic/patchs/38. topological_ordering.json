The original code only considered the nodes with no incoming nodes as the starting point for the topological ordering. However, it failed to consider the remaining nodes that were not included in the initial `ordered_nodes` list. To fix this, we create a new list called `remaining_nodes` that contains all the nodes that are not in `ordered_nodes`.\n\n2. We introduce a `while` loop that continues until all the nodes are processed (i.e., `remaining_nodes` becomes empty).\n\n3. Inside the `while` loop, we iterate over each node in `remaining_nodes`. For each node, we check if all of its incoming nodes (prerequisites) are already present in the `ordered_nodes` list. We use the `all()` function to check if all the incoming nodes are in `ordered_nodes`.\n\n4. If a node has all its prerequisites satisfied (i.e., all incoming nodes are in `ordered_nodes`), we append that node to `ordered_nodes`, remove it from `remaining_nodes`, and set the `progress` flag to `True`. We then break out of the inner loop to start the next iteration of the outer loop.\n\n5. If no progress is made in an iteration (i.e., no nodes can be added to `ordered_nodes`), it means there is a cycle in the graph, and a topological ordering is not possible. In this case, we raise a `ValueError` with an appropriate message.\n\n6. Finally, if the loop completes without encountering a cycle, we return the `ordered_nodes` list, which represents the topological ordering of the nodes.\n\nThis fixed code ensures that all nodes are considered and properly ordered based on their dependencies. It also handles the case of a cyclic graph by raising an exception."
