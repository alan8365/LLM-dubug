In the line `ends[length + 1] = i`, `i` was changed to `val`. The `ends` dictionary should store the actual values, not the indices.\n\n3.

This ensures that `longest` is updated correctly when a longer increasing subsequence is found.\n\nWith these changes, the code should now correctly find the length of the longest increasing subsequence in the given array."

In the line `prefix_lengths = [j for j in range(1, longest + 1) if arr[ends[j]] < val]`, `arr[ends[j]]` was used, but `ends` is a dictionary that stores the values directly, not the indices. So, it should be `ends[j] < val` instead.\n\n2. In the line `ends[length + 1] = i`, `i` was being stored as the value in the `ends` dictionary, but it should be the actual value `val` instead. So, it should be `ends[length + 1] = val`.\n\n3. In the line `longest = length + 1`, the `longest` variable was being updated unconditionally. However, it should only be updated if the current `length + 1` is greater than the current value of `longest`. So, it should be `longest = max(longest, length + 1)`.\n\nWith these fixes, the code should correctly find the length of the longest increasing subsequence in the given array `arr`."

In the line `prefix_lengths = [j for j in range(1, longest + 1) if arr[ends[j]] < val]`, `arr[ends[j]]` was changed to `ends[j]`. The `ends` dictionary stores the index of the smallest element that ends an increasing subsequence of length `j`. Therefore, we should compare `val` directly with `ends[j]` instead of `arr[ends[j]]`.\n\n2. Added a check `length + 1 not in ends` in the condition `if length == longest or length + 1 not in ends or val < arr[ends[length + 1]]`. This ensures that we only compare `val` with `arr[ends[length + 1]]` if `length + 1` exists as a key in the `ends` dictionary. Otherwise, it would raise a `KeyError` if `length + 1` is not present in `ends`.\n\n3. Updated the line `longest = length + 1` to `longest = max(longest, length + 1)`. This ensures that `longest` is updated correctly when a new longest increasing subsequence is found. Using `max()` prevents `longest` from being overwritten with a smaller value.\n\nWith these changes, the `lis` function should work as expected and find the length of the longest increasing subsequence in the given array `arr`."
