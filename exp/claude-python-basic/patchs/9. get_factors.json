When `n` is 1, the function should return `[1]` instead of an empty list, since 1 is considered a factor of itself.\n\n2. The original code only returned the first pair of factors found and then recursively called `get_factors` with the quotient. However, this approach missed some factors and did not handle the case when a factor is paired with itself (e.g., 4 is a factor of 16, but 4 * 4 = 16).\n\n3. To fix this, we initialize an empty list called `factors` to store all the factors found.\n\n4. We iterate from 2 to the square root of `n` (inclusive) and check if each number divides `n` evenly. If it does, we add both the number and its paired factor (`n // i`) to the `factors` list.\n\n5. We add a condition `if i != n // i` to avoid duplicating the factor when it is paired with itself (e.g., in the case of 4 being a factor of 16).\n\n6. After the loop, we sort the `factors` list in ascending order and return it.\n\nWith these fixes, the `get_factors` function will correctly return a sorted list of all the factors of the given number `n`."

Inside the loop, when a factor `i` is found, the line `factors.extend([i] + get_factors(n // i))` is used instead of `return [i] + get_factors(n // i)`. This change ensures that all factors are collected in the `factors` list before returning.\n\n4. The `return` statement inside the loop is moved outside the loop to return the `factors` list only after all factors have been found.\n\n5. If no factors are found in the loop (i.e., `n` is a prime number), the function returns `[n]` instead of an empty list `[]`. This is because a prime number has only two factors: 1 and itself.\n\nWith these fixes, the `get_factors` function should correctly return the list of factors for a given number `n`."
