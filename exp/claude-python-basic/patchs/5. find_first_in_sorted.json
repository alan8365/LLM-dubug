The initial value of `hi` was changed from `len(arr)` to `len(arr) - 1`. This is because the indices of the array range from 0 to `len(arr) - 1`, and `hi` should represent the last valid index.\n\n2. In the `elif` condition, the comparison was changed from `x <= arr[mid]` to `x < arr[mid]`. This ensures that the search continues in the correct half of the array when the target element is not found at the current `mid` index.\n\n3. When updating `hi` in the `elif` block, it was changed from `hi = mid` to `hi = mid - 1`. This is because `mid` has already been checked and found to be greater than the target element, so we need to search in the lower half of the array.\n\nWith these changes, the `find_first_in_sorted` function should correctly find the index of the first occurrence of the target element `x` in the sorted array `arr`, or return -1 if the element is not found."

When updating `hi` in the `elif` block, it should be `hi = mid - 1` instead of `hi = mid`. This is because `mid` is already checked and found to be greater than `x`, so the search should continue in the left half of the array, excluding `mid`.\n\nWith these changes, the `find_first_in_sorted` function should work correctly to find the index of the first occurrence of `x` in the sorted array `arr`.

In the initialization of `hi`, it should be set to `len(arr) - 1` instead of `len(arr)`. This is because the valid indices of the array range from 0 to `len(arr) - 1`. Setting `hi` to `len(arr)` would result in an out-of-bounds error when accessing `arr[mid]` if `mid` becomes equal to `len(arr)`.\n\n2. In the `elif` condition, the comparison should be `x < arr[mid]` instead of `x <= arr[mid]`. This is because if `x` is equal to `arr[mid]`, we want to search in the right half of the array to find the first occurrence of `x`. By using `x < arr[mid]`, we ensure that the search continues in the left half only if `x` is strictly less than `arr[mid]`.\n\n3. When updating `hi` in the `elif` block, it should be set to `mid - 1` instead of `mid`. This is because `mid` is the index where `x` is greater than or equal to `arr[mid]`, so we can exclude `mid` from the search range and set `hi` to `mid - 1` to search in the left half of the array.\n\nWith these fixes, the `find_first_in_sorted` function should correctly find the index of the first occurrence of `x` in the sorted array `arr`, or return -1 if `x` is not found."
