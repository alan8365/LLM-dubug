Changed `is` to `==` for equality comparison between `node` and `goalnode`.\n2. Modified the iteration over `node.successors` to iterate over the neighbors and their corresponding edge lengths using `length_by_edge[node].items()`.\n3. Simplified the `insert_or_update` logic by directly updating the distance in the heap if `nextnode` is already present, and adding it to the heap if it's not present.\n4. Removed the unnecessary `get` function.\n5. Renamed `insert_or_update` to `heappush` and `heapify` to maintain the heap property after updating a distance.\n\nThe fixed code should now work correctly and efficiently find the shortest path length using Dijkstra's algorithm with a heap data structure."
