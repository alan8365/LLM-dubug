It should be `steps.append((start, end))` instead.\n\nExplanation:\n- The `hanoi` function takes three parameters: `height` (the number of disks), `start` (the starting peg), and `end` (the destination peg).\n- The function uses recursion to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem.\n- The base case is when `height` is 0, in which case an empty list of steps is returned.\n- For heights greater than 0, the function does the following:\n  - It calculates the helper peg by subtracting the start and end pegs from the set {1, 2, 3} and popping the remaining element.\n  - It recursively calls `hanoi(height - 1, start, helper)` to move the top `height - 1` disks from the start peg to the helper peg.\n  - It appends the step of moving the largest disk from the start peg to the end peg.\n  - It recursively calls `hanoi(height - 1, helper, end)` to move the `height - 1` disks from the helper peg to the end peg.\n- Finally, the function returns the list of steps.\n\nThe bug in the original code was that it appended the step of moving the largest disk from the start peg to the helper peg instead of the end peg. By changing `steps.append((start, helper))` to `steps.append((start, end))`, the bug is fixed, and the function correctly solves the Tower of Hanoi problem."
