As a result, the search could potentially visit the same node multiple times, leading to infinite recursion if there are cycles in the graph.\n\nTo fix this, we need to add the visited node to the `nodesvisited` set after checking if it has already been visited. This ensures that each node is visited only once during the depth-first search.\n\nHere's the corrected line:\n```python\nnodesvisited.add(node)  # Add this line to mark the node as visited\n```\n\nBy adding this line after the check `if node in nodesvisited`, we mark the current node as visited before proceeding with the search. This prevents revisiting the same node and avoids infinite recursion.\n\nThe rest of the code remains the same. The depth-first search function will now correctly traverse the graph, avoiding cycles and returning `True` if a path exists from the start node to the goal node, and `False` otherwise."

The condition `node is goalnode` was using the `is` operator instead of `==`. The `is` operator checks for object identity, while `==` checks for equality. In this case, we want to check if `node` is equal to `goalnode`, so we should use `==`.\n\n2. The `nodesvisited` set was not being updated when a node was visited. This could lead to revisiting the same nodes multiple times, potentially causing an infinite recursion if there are cycles in the graph. To fix this, we add `nodesvisited.add(node)` before making recursive calls to `search_from()`.\n\nWith these fixes, the `depth_first_search()` function should work as intended. It performs a depth-first search starting from `startnode` and returns `True` if `goalnode` is reachable, and `False` otherwise. The `nodesvisited` set keeps track of the nodes that have been visited to avoid revisiting them."
