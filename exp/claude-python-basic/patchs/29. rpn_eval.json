In RPN (Reverse Polish Notation), the operands are popped from the stack in reverse order. The original code had `a = stack.pop()` followed by `b = stack.pop()`, which would lead to incorrect results.\n\nThe fixed code changes the order of popping the operands from the stack:\n```python\nb = stack.pop()\na = stack.pop()\n```\n\nNow, the operands are popped in the correct order (`b` first, then `a`), ensuring that the operations are performed correctly according to RPN.\n\nAdditionally, the condition for checking if a token is a number has been updated to include both `float` and `int` types:\n```python\nif isinstance(token, (float, int)):\n```\n\nThis allows the code to handle both floating-point and integer numbers correctly.\n\nWith these fixes, the `rpn_eval` function should now correctly evaluate expressions in Reverse Polish Notation."

In the `op` function, the order of operands for subtraction and division was incorrect. It should be `b - a` and `b / a` instead of `a - b` and `a / b`, respectively. This is because in RPN, the operands are evaluated in the order they appear, so the second operand (b) should come before the first operand (a) for non-commutative operations.\n\n2. The condition `isinstance(token, float)` was changed to `isinstance(token, (int, float))` to handle both integer and floating-point numbers as valid operands.\n\n3. A check was added to ensure that there are at least two operands on the stack before performing an operation. If there are insufficient operands, a `ValueError` is raised with an appropriate message.\n\n4. After evaluating all the tokens, a check was added to ensure that there is exactly one value remaining on the stack. If there are more than one value or no values on the stack, it indicates an invalid expression, and a `ValueError` is raised.\n\nThese fixes address the issues with the order of operands for subtraction and division, handle both integer and floating-point operands, and add error handling for insufficient operands and invalid expressions."

The order of operands for subtraction and division was swapped. In RPN, the second operand should come before the first operand for these operations. The fixed code uses `b - a` for subtraction and `b / a` for division.\n\n2. The type check for tokens was updated to include both `int` and `float` types using `isinstance(token, (int, float))`.\n\n3. An additional check was added to ensure that there are enough operands in the stack before performing an operation. If there are fewer than two operands, a `ValueError` is raised.\n\n4. The order of operands was fixed when popping them from the stack. The second operand (`b`) should be popped before the first operand (`a`).\n\n5. A final check was added to ensure that there is only one value left in the stack after evaluating the RPN expression. If there are more or fewer values, a `ValueError` is raised.\n\nThese fixes should resolve the bugs in the original code and ensure proper evaluation of RPN expressions."
