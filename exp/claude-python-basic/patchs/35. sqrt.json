Added a check for negative input values. The square root of a negative number is undefined in the real number system, so we raise a `ValueError` if `x` is negative.\n\n2. Added a check for `x` being zero. If `x` is zero, we can directly return zero as the square root of zero is zero.\n\n3. Fixed the condition in the `while` loop. The original condition `abs(x - approx) > epsilon` was incorrect. It should compare the absolute difference between the squared approximation (`approx ** 2`) and the input value `x` with the epsilon value. This ensures that the approximation converges to the desired accuracy.\n\nWith these fixes, the `sqrt` function should now work correctly and handle different input scenarios appropriately."

The condition `abs(x - approx) > epsilon` was comparing the difference between `x` and `approx` directly, which is not the correct way to check if the approximation is close enough to the actual square root.\n\nTo fix this, we need to compare the squared value of `approx` with `x`. The correct condition should be `abs(approx**2 - x) > epsilon`. This checks if the absolute difference between the squared value of `approx` and `x` is greater than the specified `epsilon` value.\n\nWith this modification, the function will continue iterating until the squared value of `approx` is close enough to `x` within the given `epsilon` tolerance.\n\nThe rest of the code remains the same. The function uses the Newton-Raphson method to iteratively improve the approximation of the square root until the desired precision is achieved.\n\nYou can now use the fixed `sqrt` function to calculate the approximate square root of a number with a specified precision (`epsilon`)."
