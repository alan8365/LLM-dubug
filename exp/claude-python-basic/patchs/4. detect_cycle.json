Added a check at the beginning of the function to handle the case where the input `node` is `None`. If `node` is `None`, it means the linked list is empty, and there can't be a cycle, so the function returns `False`.\n\n2. Modified the condition in the `while` loop to check if `hare` itself is `None` before checking `hare.successor`. This is necessary because if `hare` becomes `None` (indicating the end of the linked list), accessing `hare.successor` would raise an `AttributeError`. By checking `hare` first, we ensure that we don't try to access the `successor` of `None`.\n\n3. The rest of the code remains the same. The `tortoise` pointer moves one step at a time, while the `hare` pointer moves two steps at a time. If there is a cycle in the linked list, the `hare` and `tortoise` pointers will eventually meet at the same node, indicating the presence of a cycle, and the function returns `True`. If the `hare` pointer reaches the end of the linked list (`None`), it means there is no cycle, and the function returns `False`.\n\nWith these fixes, the `detect_cycle` function should correctly detect the presence of a cycle in a linked list."

This ensures that we don't access the `successor` of `None`, which would raise an `AttributeError`.\n\n3. Removed the unnecessary `while True` loop since the loop condition is now checked in the `while` statement itself.\n\n4. Moved the `return False` statement outside the loop.
